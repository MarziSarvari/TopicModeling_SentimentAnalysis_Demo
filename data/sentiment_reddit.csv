False,Informative Writeup About Nanoplastic Pollution in the Oceans,"**Informative Writeup about Nanoplastic Pollution in the Oceans**

What is nanoplastic ocean pollution:

There are many people who are aware of the environmental issues caused by the buildup of human waste products, composed mostly of plastic goods such as grocery bags, in the ocean gyres(circulating ocean currents). However most people do not realize the subsequent problem caused by the degradation of macro scale synthetic plastics into molecular sized micro & nano plastics which go on to circulate the entire ocean & thus interfere--usually in a detrimental fashion--with the biochemical interactions of every ecosystem in the ocean; disrupting marine ecosystems has indirect impacts, once again mostly negative, on the environmental integrity of ecosystems as well as the biogeochemical, energy & resource cycles that regulate the planet. Nanoplastics are composed of artificially bonded carbon & hydrogen atoms with additions of elements such as oxygen, chlorine & nitrogen using non biological processes that rely on machinery & other human technology to be produced.

Cause of nanoplastic ocean pollution:

Human civilization & the associated industrial production of consumer goods is arguably the sole cause of the mass pollution of the oceans with artificial, environmentally toxic, nanoplastic particles. Put simply, the reason there are nanoplastic particles dispersed to nearly every marine ecosystem is that human civilization, since the mid 1800s, has been producing synthetic plastic products in huge numbers due to the economic efficiency of plastic & subsequently disposing of massive amounts of plastic waste products into the Ocean without considering the long-term consequences of such ignorance.

Environmental impact:

Because of their foreign, artificial & man-made molecular structure nanoplastics are uniquely stable & hardy to the point they persist throughout numerous marine ecosystems, usually decreasing the biodiversity, energy yield, resource yield & overall integrity of the ecosystems. Nanoplastic particles accumulate in the biological organs of marine species--from coastal sea kelp to deep sea jellyfish--, which negatively impacts their biochemical regulation of homeostasis & growth, causing the populations of numerous marine species to collapse. Also, nanoplastics can integrate chemically into physical components of the ocean such as the seafloor or underwater thermal vents, the long-term environmental impacts of these interactions have not been studied extensively yet.

Human impact:

Due to bioaccumulation of nanoplastic particles in the organs of marine organisms from producer species like seaweed to consumers such as fish & clams, humans also consume relatively large amounts of toxic, synthetic, reactive & potentially carcinogenic nanoplastic particles when they consume food that is sourced from the ocean. Accumulation of nanoplastics in vital organs such as the heart, liver, kidneys & more has caused significant health issues for humans, however more research must be done on the long term impact of nanoplastic interaction with human organs & biochemical processes in order to better understand the array of subsequent health issues & how to treat them. Either way, chemicals that were completely alien & nonexistent to human civilization only 200 years ago are now biochemically integrated into the organs of basically every living thing on Earth, including humans.

Methods currently being used to combat nanoplastic ocean pollution:

* According to the scientists who wrote the article linked below, “In this respect, [thermochemical conversion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/thermochemical-conversion) of plastic waste into energy is a promising management option. Further, molecular and -omics technologies can also facilitate the [microbial biodegradation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/microbial-biodegradation) of MPs/NPs by enhancing enzymatic activity levels.”  

   * Thermochemical conversion is the use of heat energy & manipulation of chemical reactions in order to convert the chemical structure of nanoplastic particles into a compound that is less environmentally toxic while also harnessing usable energy from the process.
   * Microbial biodegradation involves genetically engineering the appropriate genetic code for the enzymes, regulatory sequences, transcription factors & other accessory hereditary information necessary into the RNA or DNA of a bacterial strain such that the strain metabolizes particles of nanoplastic, with the product of the metabolic reaction being a non environmentally toxic compound.
* The ocean cleanup project aims to remove macro size waste from the ocean gyres using an autonomous ocean garbage sweeper mechanism & carrier vessels for the collected garbage.

How individuals/***you*** can contribute to solving the problem:

* Decrease your personal consumption of consumer goods, especially goods manufactured using plastic or packaged in plastic products.
* Whenever you see litter outside, specifically in relatively undisturbed ecosystems such as forests or coastlines, pick up & properly dispose of the litter.
* Use goods made from recycled materials or biodegradable materials that are more environmentally sustainable.
* If you really want to contribute: Become a scientist who researches sustainable biotechnology & biochemical environment regulation techniques or become an environmental activist/preservationist.

False,Request for feedback on my starter list of ways for people to avoid toxic chemicals,"I recently finished reading Count Down ([https://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/count-down-1](https://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/count-down-1)) by Shanna H. Swan & Stacey Colino (2020) which is about how toxic chemicals including endocrine disrupting chemicals are damaging our health including our sexual health. I am brand-new to this subject and I was shocked by how much harm we are doing to ourselves. As I was reading the book I was noting down recommendations by the authors for how to avoid toxic chemicals with an eye towards writing some kind of list I could share with my family & close friends.

After reading the book I felt like a ""starter list"" would be best to focus on ""Do's & don't's"" as the easiest entry point. Then if people are interested enough, they can choose to take the next step of finding healthy natural organic alternatives.

So below is my starter list of ways for people to avoid toxic chemicals. **I would love your feedback and critique if you have time. I am especially interested about whether any of my suggestions below are wrong or out of date.**

Thank you

* If you do choose to have carpet, opt for natural materials
* When selecting area rugs, choose wool or natural plant materials. Look for materials such as jute, seagrass or sisal, and natural rubber nonskid padding.
* Use low-VOC adhesives to install carpets
* Regardless of flooring, use doormats and don't wear shoes indoors. Taking off your shoes will prevent tracking in dirt and pollutants.
* Avoid stain or waterproofing treatments on your carpets
* Vacuum all carpets and rugs thoroughly using a machine with a HEPA filter at least once a week
* Don't use shoe polishes and carpet cleaners containing trichloroethylene (TCE)
* Wipe surfaces of dust using a wet cloth or mop
* Don't use plastic containers for food storage. Use glass, stainless steel, ceramic, or porcelain containers with tops or aluminium foil.
* Never reheat food in plastic in the microwave. Transfer it to a plate or a bowl.
* Don't use nonstick cookware. Switch to cast-iron pots & pans or stainless steel. Also consider ceramic, porcelain, anodized aluminium cookware, or glass bakeware.
* Only drink water that has already been filtered for toxic chemicals & microplastics
* Use glass or stainless steel for drink bottles
* Avoid black plastic cooking utensils
* Don't use a plastic reusable cup or a bamboo reusable cup. Choose a stainless steel, ceramic, porcelain or glass reusable cup.
* Eat a home-cooked fresh food diet. Choose fresh ingredients such as loose fruit and loose vegetables. Buy from bulk stores where you can refill your own containers.
* Buy organic seasonal locally-grown food
* if you are unable to buy organic food 100% of the time, avoid eating non-organic products which contain the highest amounts of pesticide residues such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and apples
* Avoid packaged food or drink such as plastic bottles, food wrapped in plastic wrap, takeaways in fast food containers, food packaged in greaseproof lining, canned foods, packaging labelled with recycling codes 3 or 7
* Reduce your consumption of canned food
* Don't eat fast food
* Don't eat microwave popcorn
* Don't drink out of cans
* To avoid exposure to dioxins (a harmful chemical) eat a vegan diet. More than 90% of human exposure to dioxins is through food, mainly meat and dairy products, fish and shellfish.
* If you do want to eat meat, avoid processed meat. Choose hormone-free beef and hormone-free dairy.
* If you do want to eat fish, choose fish with the lowest toxic chemical content
* Use period products that are plastic-free, unscented, and labelled ""totally chlorine free (TCF)""
* Where possible use reusable period products such as silicon cups, reusable pads, reusable tampon applicators, and period pants/period underwear
* Don't use anti-mold paints in the home
* Don't wear face masks and other personal protective equipment containing nanographene and other nanoparticles

* Buy children's toys that are labelled phthalate-free, PVC-free, BPA-free, BPS-free, and BPF-free
* Avoid children's toys that smell strongly of chemicals or are heavily scented.
* Avoid soft plastic children's toys, as these can contain endocrine disruptors like phthalates.
* Choose natural rubber children's toys
* If a children's toy is painted or treated with varnish or other coatings, make sure it is non-toxic, free from lead, and meant for children
* When furnishing the playroom, include natural materials whenever possible. Choose wooden tables and chairs, with cushions if desired, and baskets, rather than plastic bins, to hold children's toys and art supplies
* Unpack any new children's toy and leave it outdoors to let some of the hazardous chemicals evaporating
* Buy solid wooden children's toys with as few glued parts as possible
* Buy unvarnished and painted children's toys wherever possible or watch out for non-toxic and natural finishes
* Don't buy school uniforms that have PFAS-based stain resistance (check the labels before you buy)
* Don't use face paint with toxic ingredients on children
* Buy nappies that are chemical free. Opt for organic cotton, fragrance-free, and reusable nappies

* Use PFAS-free dental floss
* When buying abroad or online, be aware the same product can contain harmful chemicals depending on where you buy it
* If you live outside the EU, choose products that are sold in the EU. The EU has the strictest chemical regulations in the world, and so these cosmetics may have fewer harmful chemicals in them.
* Don't use nail varnish and nail remover
* Don't purchase or use products with the ingredients 'fragrance' or 'parfum'
* Don't use vinyl shower curtains

* Buy organic-cotton mattress pads, not ones with the plastic barriers that will release their own chemicals into the air
* Don't buy clothes that are treated with fluorinated chemicals called PFAS to make them waterproof or stain resistant
* Don't use synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and synthetic fertilisers
* Use organic fertiliser (home-made or store-bought) e.g. use grass clippings as fertiliser on your lawn
* Avoid handling till receipts as much as possible
* Don't put till receipts in the recycling bin – because they can contaminate the entire recycling stream

&#x200B;

* Check suspect ingredients in hair sprays, nail polishes, hair dyes, shampoos, body wash products, body creams, moisturisers, make-ups, soaps, lipsticks, deodorants, antiperspirants, cleaning products, and fragrances against the SIN List ([https://sinlist.chemsec.org/](https://sinlist.chemsec.org/)).

&#x200B;

* As a rule it's best to avoid products labelled as having anti-microbial properties
* Use mobile apps to identify toxic chemicals: In Germany, France and the UK, you can use apps to identify cosmetics containing chemicals that you should avoid. In Germany, use Tox Fox, in France use Clean Beauty, and in the UK try Giki ([https://gikibadges.com/](https://gikibadges.com/)).",Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability,Disgust (Negative)
False,Eating less Meat won't save the Planet. Here's Why:,"I know this is a touchy subject for many, so apologies for the clickbait title ^(()*^(taken from the video I'd like to discuss)*^().)

In my opinion there are three core pillars behind vegetarianism

* **Ethics**
* **Health**
* **Environment**

I 100% agree with the **ethical** point, which is why I've lowered my consumption and only buy from our local farm.

I'm not sure about the **Health** aspects, there seems to be very good evidence pointing in both directions. But restricting an entire food group from my diet without overwhelming evidence doesn't seem like the right thing for me.

The point I'm mainly interested in however, is the **Environmental** one. I've always held the belief that meat consumption is a hard net-negative on the environment, but I recently watched [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGG-A80Tl5g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGG-A80Tl5g) which made me reconsider what I've always held as a given truth. He also raises a good point on food waste, which I don't hear people talk very much about. I'd love to hear what your thoughts are!

\_\_\_\_  
Although I am happy to discuss vegetarianism from a broader point of view (it is the subject after all), I would at the same time like to avoid this turning into a shit-slinging contest.

False,When is the best time to acknowledge man's fault?,"*COVID-19 is a new dangerous infectious disease that causes illness in animals or humans. Everyone can see people dying from a lack of oxygen and for this we are blaming the government, blaming people for spreading the virus by breaking the law. Guys please unwind for a moment and consider where it all began, China? The United States of America? Or bats as the best answer? No, we started it, and each and every one of us is to blame. People in this human race have forgotten about the most important aspect of our lives: oxygen. God has taken responsibility for breathing without our knowledge, and we have forgotten about it. If God had given us the responsibility of being responsible for our own air, we would never cut trees, and we would never allow this discrepancy to occur.*

*Money is important for survival, as everyone tells their children, but it cannot be more important than your life. Everyone is obsessed with wealth, and as a result, people are destroying Mother Earth to satisfy their greed, We humans have a habit of taking everything we see; we see land, we take it, we see the moon, mars, and we try our hardest to acquire it, we see an animal, we want to hunt it, eat it, or at the very least pet it. we just don't like things being independent, we want it under our influence. I don't think it'll be long before we have to pay for oxygen to breathe, just like we have to pay for water. Earth has been providing us with free resources for a long time, but we have overused and ruined them and the best part is that this is not a new piece of information. Everyone is aware of it, but they are unable to change, why? As a result of the culture, we have created? Or a lack of understanding? We all know the key cause is an imbalance in our climate, so why isn’t anyone willing to focus on it? Because it would be a waste of time? Or Because we don’t earn anything out of it? Friends, we’re earning the most valuable thing by ensuring the safety of our world, our lives, and our future generations. What good is money when you’re begging for oxygen to survive?*

*We’ve already faced the first wave and gone through lockdown; we all, including the government, should have planned something to address the environmental crisis. For example, every weekend, each and every person should work on cleaning their surroundings, cleaning lakes, planting trees, and maintaining them, avoid things that harm our planet. But once the lockdown was lifted, we were all ecstatic and resumed our normal routines as if nothing had happened.*

*Friends, I’d like to ask everyone to think about it. Human consumption, population, global trade, and urbanization have all increased dramatically in the last 50 years, resulting in mankind consuming more of the Earth’s resources that it will replenish naturally. Between 1970 and 2016, the population sizes of mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians decreased by an average of 68 percent, according to a recent WWF survey. The report attributes biodiversity loss to a number of causes, the most significant of which is land usage, specifically the conversion of ecosystems such as forests, grasslands, and mangroves into agricultural systems. Temperatures are rising as a result of increased greenhouse gas emissions, causing catastrophic events all over the world. Just this year, Australia experienced one of the most devastating bushfire seasons ever recorded, locusts swarming across parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, and scientists warning that the planet has crossed a series of tipping points that would lead to catastrophic events. For the first time, microplastic was discovered in Antarctic ice, temperatures in Antarctica rose above 20 degrees, warnings of advancing permafrost melt in Arctic regions, the Greenland ice sheet melting at an unprecedented rate, news of the accelerating sixth mass extinction, increasing deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, and Air pollution is exacerbating the spread of COVID-19, China is experiencing its worst floods in decades, methane levels are at their highest on record, Canada’s last intact ice shelf is collapsing, a national park in the United States has reported the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth, 13 % of deaths in the EU are linked to various forms of pollution, and a report claims that population size is a factor in the spread of COVID-19 – and these are just a fraction of the events.* 

*After all of this, why aren’t we taking it seriously? I know there are a few pretty positive programs around the world to address environmental issues, but I believe it won’t be enough until every human being thinks the same way about our mother earth, loves her, cares about her, and respects her. “we all know coronavirus itself is the earth’s vaccine, and we humans are the virus,” according to all of the studies. It’s obvious that she’s trying to communicate with us, but no one is willing to listen, which breaks my heart. How can we forget that we are all reliant on each other? We are here because of her. How can we survive if she dies? We mourn when we see family members die, but how can we forget that we are all one family, and we must protect everyone, including birds, trees, and animals, not just our immediate surroundings of four people.*

*I request that the government impose strict regulations on this, and I would like to remind everyone that nature is not just government property, it is the property of all living beings we are here to enjoy its beauty as it is without disturbing it. Maintaining the environment in our daily lives is not difficult. I know a lot of us are doing it, but there are few of us who aren’t. Let’s start with the basics, we can keep water and food on our terraces for birds, feed street dogs, form a community, and clean a nearby lake every weekend, we can grow plants, in every 3bhk home, there should be three large trees, in a small home, at least one, here should be trees on both the sides of roads in the city. Trust me it will be fun you will love it . It’s for us, not for someone else. Similarly, if you have a suggestion, please share it. Let’s all join hands and solve this, believe me, the satisfaction, pleasure, and calmness we experience in this cannot be measured by working in front of a screen or watching television, or something else. I say let's give it try.*

False,Fragility of Human Life," 

**Introduction:**

**With time the Modern Human life and living has become so fragile that the sustainability of Global Catastrophic events which ended many civilizations whose scientific and innovative powness is still a debate with no definite answers, is questionable. In recent times a minor incident like the Suez Canal blockage caused global turmoil affecting supply chains across half of the World.**

**Many events such as biological hazards (ex. COVID-19), prolonged droughts, increasing intensity of cyclones, earthquakes, etc do not have definitive answers for the community survival inclusive of the wealthy. Other natural events like Solar Flares, intensive EarthQuakes ( due to release of energy from continental plates), Tsunamis, etc are unavoidable and unpredictable ( as per technology available in 2020). The ability of the average human being to sustain is questionable especially in the developing countries which hold 60-70% of the World's population.**

**Electronic World & Realities:**

**In the 21st-century electronics and technology rule every domain of human life. E-money contributes to 90% of World wealth and 95% of World financial transactions. The wealth for which many politicians like Hitler, Stalin, and 90% of Modern World leaders kill, abuse, and betray the citizens & constitution on which they gain power, is just a solar flare away from becoming recordless.**

**Current administrative systems, record maintenance, crypto, etc are so dependent on technology that it will take a few seconds in an event of a solar flare ( which are cyclic & unavoidable in nature) for humanity to move to the stone age. While modern technology with nuclear sciences has developed enough potential to cause EMP destruction in limited geography giving enough potential for destroying several large cities in the World.**

**Hence the question arises about the fragility of human life in this modern era. The last known solar flare happened in 1859 where the World is least dependent on technology & electricity as it is now.**

**Hence people of all economic categories have to realize the importance of luxury as a prospect of survival through learning lessons from past mistakes. Except for the state of art defense facilities, not even hospitals are EMP proof considering 90% of equipment is dependent on electronic and electric circuits. Hence, a paradox always arises in what we are protecting and valuing.**

* **According to studies chance of solar flare affecting Earth is 12% in the coming one decade.**

**Food, water & energy - Future of Life**

**In modern-day living food, water and energy form the core of living. The three essentials occupy 30-40% of the net expenditure of a citizen globally. While the essentials occupy 80-90% of net expenditure in economically torn-up countries like Venezuela, Zimbabwe, etc. Average end consumer inflation of essentials stands between 10-15% in developing countries like India. Apart from financial implications, essentials are predominated by availability. On average malnutrition causes 1 million deaths annually and 0.2-0.5 million deaths are caused annually due to water pollution & shortage.**

**When we refer to classic history many civilizations inclusive of the Indus Valley in India have gone extinct due to prolonged droughts and rains. Current Global economies cannot last for more than 1 year in such an event in current times. Even a small event like 10 days of Suez canal blockage can contribute chaos to the supply chain and inflate the pricing by 10-20%.**

**Through the article, I wish to emphasize the fragility of life in the Modern World and the unpreparedness of the modern governance systems at par with historic times putting at risk the majority of the global population. Current macrosystems of management of water resources which involve lakes, reservoirs, etc have 50-60% evaporation factor in a country like India making them inefficient. Macrosystems in agriculture also contribute to water, soil, and air pollution due to excessive usage of agriculture chemicals & nutrients apart from producing just 40% of optimum yields in India. Macrosystems in energy (electricity) contribute 1 kg carbon emission for kilowatt (unit) of electricity to the end consumer with 15-20% as transmission loss in India.**

**Macrosystems are inefficient, expensive, and polluting. When resources like water & food which have limited availability become scarce with time the only way to increase the availability is through efficiency than capacity. In the current times of Global Warming, another resource that would be reducing with time would be the availability of land which results in an imbalance of food supply (60-70% global food inclusive of cash crops like sugarcane, cotton, rubber, etc are produced in coastal zones. Majority of which would be affected by rising sea-levels due to global warming.), forest area and settlement zones.**

* **According to studies top metropolitans & cities in the World are going to face an acute shortage of water by 2050.**
* **According to the UN, the World is going to face acute food shortages for the next 50 years due to the effects of global warming.**
* **According to studies, the average household consumption of electricity emits 14-25 tons of carbon annually which requires 3-7 acres of forest land to absorb.**

**Adulteration of resources- Economics over humanity**

**Adulteration of resources is one of the major contributing factors for crisis and chaos in modern human life costing annually trillions of dollars annually to governance bodies and individuals. The fascinating thing about adulteration is 50-75% of adulteration happens legally. The global emphasis on economics & power over human life has resulted in this scenario. Some of the important legal food adulterations are as follows**

1. **80-90% of honey available in the US is adulterated.**
2. **75-80% of antibiotics manufactured in the World are used in the poultry & dairy industry.**
3. **Genetically Modified crop varieties represent 60-75% of the modern food supply chain which intensify health effects like cancers, renal disorders, liver issues, etc.**
4. **The majority of modern foods contain high concentrations of sugars in many generic names like cane sugar, fructose, dextrose, corn syrup, etc causing diabetes, obesity, gastrological disorders, etc.**
5. **60-80% of freshwater resources globally are contaminated by chemicals way above human tolerance levels causing cancers, renal disorders, allergies, chronic diseases, etc.**
6. **Power fluctuations and interruptions globally cause individuals & companies hundreds of billions of dollars in loss of productivity, damage to systems, etc apart from causing considerable deaths annually.**

**Apart from the above the adulteration of resources is causing health chaos which in many cases results in the transmission of health ailments like cancers, allergies, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, renal disorders, hormonal issues, etc to future generations. The phenomenon is not only adding financial burden but also human pain & suffering to future generations.**

**Additionally, globally corruption, infringement of power centers by corporates, lack of testing facilities & enforcement, etc causing the adulteration to affect global citizen life, wealth, and well-being at a rapid pace.**

* **$150 billion USD- Annual Global cancer spending ( 10 Lakh crore INR)**
* **$400 billion USD- Annual Global diabetes spending ( 24 lakh crores INR)**
* **$8.8 Trillion USD- Annual Global healthcare spending (540 lakh crores INR)**

**The above numbers in most cases are a result of abuse of average global citizen health through adulteration of resources to make financial gains by corporates, individuals, even governments, etc. Through this article, every modern citizen equipped with treasure known as knowledge has to think about the abuse we are inducing on our health as well as future generations for the purpose of economic gains ( digital money) which is just a solar flare away to reach a recordless chaotic state. Is human suffering worth our greed?**

**Bio- Hazard - An unavoidable battle of evolution**

**Over the evolutionary history of Earth, many deadly microbes which are designated as Superbugs that do not have definitive prevention & curing techniques have been frozen for millions of years in permafrost and polar ice caps in a dormant state. These microbes which have been observed & studied through deep core samples have the potential to wipe out entire species in a very short time.**

1. **2016- Anthrax outbreak in Russia due to melting of Permafrost**

**Is a classic example of the potential of such an outbreak. With 17-20% of the global food chain dependent on seafood, biohazards through polar ice caps melting can do irreversible damage and adulteration to the food chain. This also gives microbes irradiated from the meltdown of ice caps to cause global scale pandemics through compromised food chains.**

**Apart from the above, the global community experienced a major outbreak of pandemic or epidemic every decade due to man-made events and natural genetic mutations of existent microbes. With every outbreak, the Global community lost millions of innocent lives and even 30-50% of the global population in certain cases. For every event of pandemic and epidemic, the only practical answer given by modern human beings is fear than the solution.**

**As usual, the moral-less society uses every emergency to exploit the pain of fellow human beings for financial gains (digital money) and power gains through vaccines, healthcare services, hyperinflation of essentials during emergencies, etc. With the destruction we are doing to the global environment for numbers known as economics which have no value when no human being exists, we are committing an irreversible crime against the very planet & its beings on which our existence is based.**

**Future of Mega Earthquake (India)- Greediness pays the price**

**India is unique in its geography. During evolutionary history when the last supercontinent Pangea has split to form the Modern World, the fast-moving Indian plate has moved inwards into the Asian plate forming the World’s largest mountain ranges we call the Himalayas. On average Indian continental plate moves 2’’ every year causing deformation and heavy stress-energy near the conjunction. Periodically the resultant stress-energy is released in the form of massive Earthquakes which can reach an 8-9 Richter scale with the potential to cause severe damage to the entire country.**

**According to many notable studies from reputed institutes like IIT’s in India and abroad the chances of Mega Earthquake is increasing exponentially with an increase in the buildup of stress-energy. While in practicality 75-90% of buildings in India are not Earthquake resistant and 6.5-7’’ Richter scale earthquake can cause deaths of more than 40-50% of citizens causing irreversible damage to the country financial system ( for which governance & people torture citizens).**

**While there is no definitive structural solution implemented and followed due to corruption and greed overruling the basic safety of citizens. There always exists a question beyond our greed clouded minds, how do we practically face an event which is unavoidable in nature.**

**Cyclones & Global Warming - Mates of destruction**

**According to studies, every 1° C increase in global temperature will result in a 2.5-5% increase in the intensity of cyclones. The intensity of cyclones not only cause havoc through force of wind but also result in heavy downpour causing flash floods capable of blowing away even the powerful dams on Earth (three gorges recent example).**

**With average global temperatures rising 1.5-2°c every 5 years puts at risk 60-70% of the global population who are coastal & coastal fed mega cities occupants. The Indian subcontinent has 4-5 mega cyclones in the year 2020 itself with the intensity of cyclones becoming stronger with every occurrence. According to reputed studies, the Indian subcontinent 2030-2050 will face extreme weather conditions like tornados & super cyclones at par with the US & Central America. 70-80% of the coastal housing cannot withstand the forces of wind and downpour as observed in the case of Hudhud in Visakhapatnam.**

**While our greed for economic gains and instant economic growth has hampered average citizen safety and right to life. There always arises a question: what is economics or greed without life and life with chaos.**

**Conclusion:**

**Through this article, I wish to bring to everyone notice the realities of the current World as per science and its future implications as estimated by science. The effort each one of us is doing in safeguarding our future and future generations are uphoulingly minimal. But the amount of greed and cruelty we exhibit for lifeless wealth generation, storage, and preservation is uphoulingly extreme.**

**Do the future generation deserve the lifeless wealth we are creating, killing the very life of future generations through destruction of natural resources, causing health crises, killing & abusing fellow human beings, etc. I always have doubt do we truly love at least our children, this is the topic for the next article.**",Human Society and Global Issues,Fear (Negative)

HOW THE EVOLUTION OF CAPITALISM CAN SAVE THE PLANET

Dedicated to Jonah - for a better world.

&#x200B;

1. Rethink?

There are few, if any, areas of life unaffected by COVID-19. Terms including social distancing, PPE and flattening the curve form part of our everyday conversation. We are necessarily denying our most basic human need to be close and connected to one another because of a virus that forces us physically apart. Irony aside, a worldwide pandemic has brought humanity together into a state of shared experience on a level unlike any in history.

In America the lights shone and the water ran; the delivery trucks still rolled. Do we emerge from this nightmare with a sense of triumph, unapologetically returning to the ways of the past? Or do we proceed with the recognition that a world apparently too big to fail sits on an untenably fragile foundation?

The pandemic is a clarion call that lets us shake off institutional dust that may have settled over time. An unbiased (to the extent possible), open and label-free confrontation of our past is our chance for growth—a true rethink.

At the root of why, with this virus, it is different this time, is a borderless world much more tightly interconnected by trade and travel than it was during the 1918 flu pandemic. Such interconnectedness will work to our advantage if we let it. If we reflect, and turn that reflection into action, we will reach a deeper meaning to this unprecedented global experience.

So how do we make the most of this transition?

2.	Ask ‘Why?’

Rather than spouting a list of societal ills, we can examine root causes. The limits and structures of the biological, anthropological and technological realms that so dictate the form of our commerce and development are not fixed, and the outcomes we took for granted are ripe for change. As business reward systems squeezed the last cent out of the marginal customer’s pocket, few of us questioned them, and even fewer of us had the means to offer alternatives. The forces at work were bigger than us. Coordinated, collaborative economic models found no oxygen.

After all, humanity was forged in the same fiery crucible as all life on earth. Consider competition and the law of the jungle: a lion must be the biggest and most savage to ward off rival lions. This winning survival strategy applies to germs, plants, animals and humans. Indeed, the free market and conventional capitalist systems are patterned on it. Over a billion people were lifted out of extreme poverty under this regime over the last thirty years^(1).  Such a rising tide lifted all boats, and we need not minimize its positive effects.

3.	So what?

Still, the rising tide has been anything but uniform. The majority of US earnings growth accrued to the top 20 percent of earners^(2)  and large corporate interests in the last fifty years. Ordinary, hardworking people were left in a very distant second tier. The structural barriers that deny upward mobility kept quality of life nearly stagnant over the same term for the middle and lower classes. This lack of earnings growth has been estimated to equal $2.5 trillion a year, $47 trillion since 1975^(3).

And why? The short answer, the law of the jungle, dictates that those who hold power hoard power, be it Wall Street bankers, heirs and heiresses to generational fortunes, or corrupt officials. We can observe the historical thread of hoarding, starting with tribal warlords, to monarchs, to the nobility and aristocracy, to the robber barons building the industrialized world, and finally to the utter intoxication of participants in capital markets and government. We also observe little meaningful change to power dynamics along the way.

In the US, layering a democratic government over a free market solves for some of conventional capitalism’s side effects, but perverse incentives are nevertheless cross-pollinated between politics and big business. Furthermore, a constrained government lacks the resources for overwhelming success, and so the bureaucratic class does a poor job with most tasks.

Meanwhile, power hoarders have their thumb on the scale, armed as they are with ruthlessness and a focus on distributive outcomes^(4).  America may be the poster child, but this holds true for basically every place one can think of.

In 2018, the 26 wealthiest people held the same wealth as the bottom 50% of all humanity (3.8 billion people). In 2017 it was the top 43, in 2016 it was the top 61^(5).

4.	An emerging downside

Where does the status quo lead? A system so inherently and so passionately rivalrous works ‘great’ in yesterday’s world, with a billion people, or two billion people, or perhaps even five billion people—not so much at eight billion. Humanity is bumping up against the carrying capacity of earth’s gifts, with its hand on a tinderbox of social tensions ready to blaze. We are all connected; dire consequences from the next Black Swan event, no matter how far away its geographical origin, will not leave us undamaged.

Hardly a path to survival, the status quo in the real world of environmental resource constraints and outsized social power imbalances looks like an extremely bad bet. If we are not yet careening off a Thelma-&-Louise-style cliff at 100 mph, we’re only a thousand yards away going a good 45 mph. Neither braking nor steering away is an option. We must disassemble, re-engineer, and rebuild that Thunderbird convertible and take to the skies before reaching the precipice. Environmental and social tipping points are real, and we need to be planning for the consequences of crossing our first. We are lucky it didn’t come from this virus. Our addiction to some form of capitalism has been millennia in the making, and the institutional inertia is too great to ignore for one more instant.

The question of whether we can escape the forces that defined our past is existential, and the answer, therefore, binds our very future.

5.	Coordinates of the solution(s)

Does answering the question require entirely new technologies, or can we simply make use of existing technologies in novel ways? What features of existing systems—especially conventional capitalism—can be incorporated into a new and improved system with little disruption to the old and tired way of doing things? What tweaks allow for a stable evolution rather than a violent revolution?

Should such adjustments be available, then superior paths forward reveal themselves absent the attachment to any form of politics, economics or ideology. Taking this one step further: how can the best features of established systems coexist while locking out their worst features and consequences?

6.	The silo of low-hanging fruit

We may well strive for wholesale changes in the laws of the land, the roll call of our political representatives, social justice, the economy, or in our collective relationship to the natural world. Balancing our aims with what is realistic, and with what will move the needle, guides our direction.

While all societal silos^(6)  are probably ripe for a refresh, the focus of this document is commerce and economics. As important as the ballot box, economic participation is a weapon the individual can wield on a daily basis. Whereas political elections take place once every two years, we can vote with our wallet each and every day, and the effects are cumulative.

We are not, however, taking this weapon up in a meaningful way. The low-hanging fruit for effecting change is described by the primary pillar of Sustainablism: a sustainable business organization (SBO).

7.	Sustainable Business Organization (SBO)

How businesses are organized dictates how business is done as a system (see Appendix I). The impact of these choices is profound. These are the four defining organizational principles required by Sustainablist firms:

i)	50% employee ownership, 50% customer ownership

ii)	equitably minded governance

iii)	hyper-transparency

iv)	externality^(7)  recapture

(See Appendix II for brief explanations of the principles.)

8.	The SBO footprint

Any industry may contain SBOs, but Sustainablist entrepreneurs should endeavor to create a robust ecosystem of SBOs in the following sectors:

i)	agribusiness

ii)	water supply & sanitation

iii)	apparel

iv)	housing & construction

v)	energy supply

vi)	education

vii)	health care

viii)	transportation & mobility

ix)	communications

Self-determined, democratic control over these sectors is the basic outcome targeted by Sustainablism. Universally high-quality access to these resources should be seen as a prerequisite for a high-functioning, Sustainablist society. Given our daily transactions in these domains, we are overlooking almost all of our opportunity to vote for meaningful upward mobility or other forms of change.

9.	Features and consequences of SBOs

Broadly, SBO entrepreneurs work toward three outcomes:

i)	levelling the socioeconomic playing field (rising tides lift all boats equitably)

ii)	establishing superior economic equilibria^(8)  and outcomes

iii)	reducing the work of government

All four of the SBO organizational principles from section 7 play a role in achieving these outcomes, but a special focus on superior economic equilibria (see Appendix III and this section) makes the strongest case.

To explore what is different in an SBO ecosystem, we have to understand the status quo (see Appendix IV), namely that the basic stock and trade of power hoarders is asymmetric information^(9),  the fungibility of power^(10),  and differential advantage^(11).  These are the thumb-on- the-scale effects that result in errors in the attribution of profit—and, ultimately, inequity.

Profit is a crucial component of SBO transactions, and it is attributed to a firm’s individual owners just as in conventional capitalism. The traditionally accepted view of capitalism is that the pursuit of profit should be the primary goal of the firm. This need not change under Sustainablism. Obviously, should the owners of a firm wish to keep realizing this profit, then decisions that would lead to the collapse of the firm must be avoided. Although there are many decisions to be made for a working SBO, the most important for our immediate discussion relates to setting the market clearing price^(12)  on any good or service.

Let us compare price-setting under conventional capitalism and Sustainablism. Under the former, no firm will:

•	increase prices beyond the point where customers are willing to purchase the good or service produced by the firm: no willingness to pay = no sales = no firm = no profit for the owners

•	decrease prices beyond the point the firm can cover the cost of producing the good or service: no means of production = no sales = no firm = no profit for the owners^(13)

Firms naturally seek the highest possible price for their goods and services, and customers seek the lowest possible price. This tension is settled by the free market and the forces of supply and demand.

In contrast, Sustainablism establishes or assumes the following to achieve equilibrium:

•	firms are composed of employees (specifically, the managerial class^(14)) who set the prices of their goods and services

•	sales are executed with customers, who accept the sales price

•	this setting and acceptance of prices is required for a transaction to take place

•	transactions create profits for owners

•	owners want continuing profits

•	because owners want continuing profits, they will make decisions that ensure the long-term life of the firm (rather than its destruction)

•	Sustainablist firms are 50:50 owned by employees and customers

•	Because ownership of Sustainablist firms is held equally by employees and customers, they must therefore fairly resolve any underlying tensions to set prices so that transactions can take place for themselves, as owners, to realize profit

Under the SBO framework, every transaction involves owners seeking fairness and long-term sustainability. The effect cascades up and down the supply chain because the sellers of goods and services to end consumers are indeed customers themselves (and therefore owners) of their suppliers^(15).  Instead of fighting over 100 percent ‘ownership’ of one side of every transaction, an assemblage of SBO firms effectively becomes 50 percent owners of all sides of every transaction in a given supply chain, with consumption restricted to the goods and services customers actually want to buy, as profit-seeking owners.

Ownership is by far the most important path to wealth and is therefore the most important means of levelling the socioeconomic playing field. Furthermore, with ownership supercharging agency, Sustainablist outcomes flowing from the bottom up gain more traction.

None of this requires the necessary government interventions found in conventional capitalism, nor the central command found in real-world applications of communism (these systems are two sides of the same law-of-the-jungle coin). Nothing conceptual should prevent us from having the same economy under Sustainablism as we do today. If producing a 99¢ hamburger involves cutting down the Brazilian rainforest for grazing and paying burger flippers near poverty wages, and if all economic actors, including customers, workers and resource suppliers, collectively decide^(16)  that what matters is producing that 99¢ hamburger, then that is what we get under Sustainablism. Hyper-transparency requires us to do this with our eyes open, externality recapture assigns a dollar cost to repairing the rainforest, and 50:50 ownership makes paying a living wage a necessity (otherwise we fail to attract any employees). While our Sustainablist stipulations mean we might not have a 99¢ hamburger anymore, whatever arrangements or product we are left with—a pricier, healthier foodstuff or a healthier food-supply chain—will, by definition, increase to the stock of society’s profit.

The superior outcomes resulting from superior equilibria drives economic efficiencies and fosters a mindset of coordination. The pursuit of profit under Sustainablism is a unifying force rather than a rivalrous one.

Because consumers, firms and resource suppliers—all economic actors in a Sustainablist framework—make decisions based on self-interest and against self-harm, government expenditure on legislating, regulating or policing corporate activity is meaningfully reduced. By relying on corporations that actually self-regulate with integrity, Sustainablism leads to smaller government while affording the free market leeway to solve our challenges in a coordinated fashion. Sustainablism’s end game, if you will, sees government focused on foreign relations^(17),  the military, large public works and taxation.

Sustainablism’s simple, natural efficiencies of less regulation and inherent cooperation achieve positive change without a forced redistribution of wealth away from power hoarders in the form of higher taxes. Sustainablism moves the invisible hand of the free market, wherever it hovers over the dark side, into the light.

The 50:50 ownership structure stipulated for SBOs is crucial for true long-term sustainability. Equilibrium is balance; any tilt towards one party introduces a drifting force and an eventual reversion to something that looks much like the status quo. Furthermore, the 50:50 structure leads to a positive blurring of the lines of the firm as individual links in supply chains coordinate more and more to produce the best goods and services possible. As the ethos of Sustainablism achieves a meaningful hold on market participants, new entrants may propose alternate ownership structures, but the reader is cautioned that these may amount to a fatal flaw^(18)  and could be the mark of mere virtue-signallers.

For Sustainablism to take hold, consumers will have to vote with their wallets in favor of SBOs. Amenable voters would number in the hundreds of millions, and they should be easy to activate in this particular moment of our history.

To the extent the ideas in this paper resonate, readers need to act to create this demand. If the clawing of power hoarders at the walls of democracy disgusts you, strongly consider your creative role by supporting emerging Sustainablist businesses. Power hoarders don’t yet realize that the bricks they tear down are the same which fortify their vaults.

10.	So, how?

There are only three fundamental problems that need to be solved before Sustainablism can gain a meaningful foothold in the real economy:

i)	the resource problem;

ii)	the technology problem; and

iii)	the coordination problem

We are very fortunate to be living in an age—for now—when we have yet to cross the line marking a general availability of resources. Society needs to act well before this changes.

The technology problem^(19)  is a matter of combining existing solutions rather than one of invention. It can be solved, likely within twelve months, given sufficient resources. Conveniently, this is probably around the same amount of time it will take to fully transition out of a COVID world.

This leaves the coordination problem. The plan for answering that can be found at [https://dunbarscafe.com/](https://dunbarscafe.com/the_plan_and_next_steps.php).

11.	Common criticisms

This is naïve and idealistic

This is optimistic—and there is a massive difference. Whether we experience an economic recession or expansion, it is nothing more than a self-fulfilling prophecy. When people are generally optimistic about their circumstances, they work and spend and the economy grows. When people are generally pessimistic, they cut back on spending, some lose their jobs and the economy shrinks. It really is as simple as that, and we need not shy away from this linkage. We should be leaning into this property and applying it to other areas of commerce. At its core, the establishment of Sustainablism represents the weaponization of optimism in a parallel economy. If people are made aware of Sustainablism and are conceptually tuned to demand the goods and services offered by SBOs, SBOs will form and fill this need^(20).

Sustainablism doesn’t require everyone’s optimism to be feasible; pessimists will remain in the larger, original system for some time. If Sustainablism is to become the dominant system, however, it does require the optimists to outcompete the pessimists. Within the fundamentally cooperative infrastructure set by SBOs, and with a levelling of the playing field that results, this should prove eminently workable.

Meanwhile, pessimists will convert to optimism in a virtuous cycle. Why? Pessimists aren’t really pessimists, they just don’t see another way. Optimists need to start showing them one, and there are certainly enough of us out there. In other words, once we hit Sustainablist critical mass, it will trigger a positive social tipping point.

This is communism/socialism

Every communist and socialist society submits to the heavy hand of central planning, bloated bureaucracies, public ownership and power hoarding that characterizes conventional capitalism. This is in opposition to what is described by Sustainablism.

Unlike communism, Sustainablism is not in conflict with conventional capitalism in any way whatsoever. Indeed, it is a form of capitalism and uses the same levers—no revolution required. With a bit of insight we can ‘hack’ our economy and change the status quo and its consequences.

The Sustainablist system relies on individual choice and private ownership to direct the economy. The profit from transactions is not directed to the single commons of socialism^(21);  rather, people direct their transactions to a commons that they themselves define, own and control. In other words, those that create profit decide where that value goes. Sustainablism is the most democratic and freedom-aligned way of organizing economic infrastructure.

This will stifle innovation

If the ownership share of entrepreneurs, as the founders of SBO firms, is reduced as it is shared with employees and customers, will they have the incentive to innovate in the first place? Firstly, money’s role as a motivator is overestimated when the fate of the planet is at stake, especially for millennials and Generation Z. Secondly, founders can still command very high compensation through their salaries. Finally, the initial ecosystem of SBOs will be focused on rolling out and scaling up existing technology in food, housing, and energy to consumers rather than creating new technologies. There is plenty of incentive for the  development of new technologies within the status quo of concentrated founder ownership, venture capital, and institutional investment in IPOs. A transitional stage may last decades, and we will not likely see innovative, high-risk startups organized as SBOs until a new generation of entrepreneurs is born into a Sustainablist economic system.

This off-ramp of sorts puts society into two classes: the innovative class, which develops new technology under the status quo, and the virtuous class, which scales existing technology using SBOs. These labels are for convenience only and are not meant to be mutually exclusive; the innovative class needs to be virtuous and the virtuous class needs to be innovative.

12.	Conclusion

Sustainablism is a centrist approach to economic thought,  the design of which should appeal to everyone across the political spectrum. It encompasses the ideals of universal access to food, shelter and the like while clinging tightly to the free market, private ownership and the maintenance of a class system. It is capitalist with respect to rules and processes and socially conscious with respect to outcomes.

Business can no longer afford to look the other way; stakeholders increasingly demand that commercial enterprise align with their values. The four organizational principles of SBOs guarantees this alignment across different supply chains and through the economy. Sustainablism requires no new technologies, and it incorporates some of the best features of existing economic systems while locking out their worst features.

In a free market system where competition ensures that humanity is always in its best age in the present moment, it is naïve to assume that there is no room for improvement. If the availability of the latest and greatest <insert your favorite product here> is a result of efficient competition between the elements within a system, what healthy outcomes arise from competition between parallel systems? Add the field of business organization to the list of those undergoing a restructuring in 2021.

While Sustainablism may not prove to be the answer, it is a very good candidate as a starting point. This paper is meant to jumpstart us into actually living the search for a new way of doing things and not just having a conversation about it. ‘Innovate or die’ never rang more true than it does today.

As we look toward a world without COVID-19, we ask: What world do we want to emerge into? How will we reconnect with each other? What will future generations say about what we made out of these circumstances and our legacy? Will the human world ultimately be one of stewardship and balance? Or will it be one of ruin? If your answer is the same as mine, let’s make the world a better place together.

We started fighting climate change back in 1992 or so.  Since 1992 energy use increased > 50% and greenhouse gases went up 45%.  Electricity is 20% of energy use  in 2020 and will be 24% by 2040.  100% renewable electricity in 2020 = 20% of energy use.  Solar & wind are < 3% of global energy use in 2020.  20% of energy will be renewable by 2040 under ideal conditions.  Battery and wind rare earth demands will cause shortages before 2030.  To delay 1.5 C we have to reduce emissions 50% in 10 years.  China poured more cement in 2 years than the US in 100 years 2017 - 2018.  10 yrs clearing the skies of smog in China raised global north temps 0.1 C.  Renewables will not delay 1.5 C or reduce emission anywhere near 50% in 10 years. Food, water, supply chain shortages and pandemics will severely affect renewables.  Battery and bio-energy extraction destroys global lands, water and wildlife.  We have to double down on extraction from the areas needing protection most.

False,Do we understand the current environmental problems?,"""Understanding our environmental issues will make us aware of their solutions. “Every contribution counts” says Gustavo Copelmayer. Environmental problems threaten our planet and the entire current and future population. Among the most pressing, are the ecosystems rich in biodiversity, water scarcity and pollution, air purity, soil desertification and, of course, climate change.

In recent years, we have witnessed progressive deforestation as a result of unsustainable agriculture and uncontrolled exploitation of wood. He points out that 70% of the earth's surface is covered with water but 97.5% of the water is from the sea, not suitable for human consumption. Additionally, we have the problem of water quality, which is making it one of the most precious assets of humanity. In fact, bad water is the cause of deadly diseases that affect all living beings, mainly children. For example, diarrhea accounts for 40% of infant deaths in an emergency, a fact that could be reversed if vulnerable populations had clean water.

Being aware of the preservation of water and oxygen, vital elements for life and health, is in our hands! ""We must emphasize the need to preserve water and be aware of events brought upon by climate change, since environmental problems also damage health,"".

With the increase in temperature, nature manifests itself in the form of rapid desertification, destruction of natural habitats, melting of the poles, extreme temperatures and the increase in natural phenomena such as typhoons or hurricanes. Climate change, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, FAO, is one of the most dangerous environmental problems, as it prevents sustainable development.

# Animal agriculture is responsible for a substantial proportion of global human-caused GHG emissions, about 14.5%. Compare this to transportation at about 13%.

   1. “With emissions estimated at 7.1 gigatonnes CO2-eq per annum, representing 14.5 percent of human-induced GHG emissions, the livestock sector plays an important role in climate change.“

Animal agriculture is the biggest contributor to global warming that individuals can practically do something about, without fundamentally changing their lifestyle. Avoiding transportation is practically impossible for most people in our globalized economy. Avoiding transportation would also mean avoiding buying things that require transportation to reach you.

For example, there will be more large-scale, industrial production, often located close to urban centres, which brings with it a range of environmental and public health risks. Attempts have been made to estimate the environmental impact of industrial livestock production. For instance, it has been estimated that the number of people fed in a year per hectare ranges from 22 for potatoes and 19 for rice to 1 and 2, respectively, for beef and lamb (9). The low energy conversion ratio from feed to meat is another concern, since some of the cereal grain food produced is diverted to livestock production. Likewise, land and water requirements for meat production are likely to become a major concern, as the increasing demand for animal products results in more intensive livestock production systems (10).”",Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability,Disgust (Negative)

A powerful coalition of the UK’s health professions has called for a climate tax to be imposed on food with a heavy environmental impact by 2025, unless the industry takes voluntary action on the impact of their products.

The group says the climate crisis cannot be solved without action to cut the consumption of food that causes high emissions, such as red meat and dairy products. But it says that more sustainable diets are also healthier and would reduce illness.

The UK Health Alliance on Climate Change (UKHACC) includes 10 Royal Colleges of medicine and nursing, the British Medical Association and the Lancet, representing the doctors, nurses and other professionals entrusted with caring for the country’s health.

The report makes a series of recommendations including a swift end to buy-one-get-one-free offers for food that is bad for health and the environment, and for perishable foods that are often wasted.

* Direct harmful effects of nano- and microplastics may be of physical and/or chemical in nature. The latter include the leaching from plastics of carcinogenic and endocrine-disrupting contaminants, such as monomers, plastic additives and polymer-associated chemicals. In addition, due to their large surface area to volume ratio, small-scale plastic particles can become heavily contaminated.

* The metals silver, gold, aluminum, and copper are inert in their bulk form but as particle size decreases, these metal‐based nanoparticles exhibit increased toxicity. 

[Silver nanoparticles have lethal and sublethal adverse effects on development](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20728-z) – Nature 2018

* **Silver** nanoparticles lead to the formation free radicals in cells and changes in the form and amount of proteins. Many serious diseases are characterized by an overproduction of free radicals in cells. This applies to cancer and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.Researchers warn that a combination of nanoparticles and contaminants may form a cocktail that is harmful to our cells. In their study, 72% of cells died after exposure to a cocktail of nano-silver and cadmium ions. We should **not** look at nanoparticles isolated when we investigate and discuss the effects, they may have on our health.

[Nanoparticles more harmful than we think](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180820094450.htm) – Science Daily 2018

* We need to take cocktail effects into account, said Professor Frank Kjeldsen, Dept of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, SDU, adding: Products with nano particles are being developed and manufactured every day, but in most countries there are no regulations, so there is no way of knowing what and how many nanoparticles are being released into the environment. In my opinion, this should be stopped.

[Effects of Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles Exposure](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12011-019-01706-6) – Springer 2019

* The toxicity of **titanium** dioxide nanoparticles depends on their size, morphology, rate of migration and amount consumed. Titanium nanoparticles can induce inflammation due to oxidative stress. They can also have a genotoxic effect leading to, among others, apoptosis or chromosomal instability. After inhalation or oral exposure, titanium nanoparticles accumulate in, among other places, the lungs, alimentary tract, liver, heart, spleen, kidneys and cardiac muscle. In addition, they disturb glucose and lipid homeostasis.

False,Why Factory Farms are Good for the Environment,"I'm just going to say right out of the gate that I want a reduction in meat consumption.

Every so often I come over here and find that a bill aiming to kill factory farms has gotten popular (again). Each time I wonder how an environmental subreddit could ever like the idea.

The meat industry is a large part of our problem yes, but the factory farm system is the only reason it hasn't completely and utterly destroyed the environment.

Factory farming is designed to be efficient. Efficient on cost, efficient on time, and (most importantly) efficient on space. 

You get a lot more meat per acre from a factory farm than you would an organic farm. That's the entire reason organic meat (and organic food as a whole) is a lot more expensive.

If you were to switch all the factory farms over to organic farms you would have to clear a LOT of wild areas to keep the same amount of production. If you don't make the same amount of meat Brazil steps up its production which requires clearing rainforests. 

And even when we lower our meat consumption a factory farm is still going to take up less space than an organic one.

Those bills that want to get rid of factory farms would be absolute hell on the environment (not to mention the start of a depression isn't exactly the best time to kill agriculture). It's rolling a cart into the middle of the street before you even purchase the horse.

Chronic consumption of refined carbohydrates has been linked to relative neurocognitive deficits across the lifespan. Hippocampal function is especially impacted, but prefrontal and mesolimbic reward pathways may also be altered. Early life exposure to refined carbohydrates, (i.e., prenatal, juvenile, and adolescence periods) may be particularly toxic to cognitive functioning.

False,The 2020 Election and it's Relation to Climate Change,"   


Climate Change is easily the greatest existential threat to civilization today. If you are not aware of its potential effects, a[ recent report by the Breakthrough Centre For Climate Restoration](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/148cb0_b2c0c79dc4344b279bcf2365336ff23b.pdf) says that Civilization could end by 2050 if Climate Change continues at the rate we see today.

Arguments can be made for Nuclear War, Mass Migration, and other issues being the greatest threat to humanity.

But steps have been taken to address those threats- especially in the United States.

Unfortunately, Climate Change has hardly been addressed in the United States in the way it needs to be. The fact that[ 97% of actively publishing climate scientists](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) believe climate change is extremely likely to be due to human activities- and that we have[ a President who outright denies climate change](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46351940)\- proves that point.

What can we do? Let’s start out with the basics. 

The United States is a world leader, no matter your view on the current government administration. [As the 12th richest country in the world](https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/economic-data/richest-countries-in-the-world), the United States has the power to help create the needed change to prevent absolutely catastrophic global warming- but we will need a complete shift away from the current political, social, and economic structure we see in the United States (and the world) today. The solutions to Climate Change are already ready to be deployed. As young activist Greta Thunberg said, “People tell me I should study to become a climate scientist so I can solve the climate crisis. But the Climate crisis has already been solved. We already have all the facts and solutions. All we have to do is wake up and change.” Greta is right. Studies have been done to show that [100% renewable energy in the United States is achievable by 2050](https://www.iflscience.com/environment/here-s-roundmap-get-us-run-100-renewable-energy-2050/). And frankly, we have no excuses, because other studies have shown [100% renewable energy around the WORLD ](https://physicsworld.com/a/a-global-100-renewable-energy-system/)is achievable by 2050. There are three sectors that I mentioned earlier that will be imperative in making lofty goals like these possible; economic, social, and political. Let’s go over them. 

Politically, lobbying is a huge problem, as[ Fossil Fuel giants pour money into the greedy mouths of corrupt](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/03/25/oil-and-gas-giants-spend-millions-lobbying-to-block-climate-change-policies-infographic/#6442f5017c4f) politicians to halt climate change action that would greatly affect Fossil Fuel Giant's profits. First off, [lobbying](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/) from Corporations must be cut off from the government- and I mean the entirety of the Government, not just Presidential Campaigns.  Then, a complete switch of executive power in the United States to a President who supports a form of a Green New Deal to push the United States to a position where leading the world to a future of[ less than 2 degrees Celsius of warming](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-heat-related-deaths) is needed. Unless those measures are taken, a future that locks in to 3 degrees Celsius of Warming is likely- and[ that would be absolutely catastrophic.](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees/?utm_source=web&utm_campaign=Redirect) But why us, some of you may be asking? Why do we have to step up when we see movements starting all around the world to oppose man made Climate Change? It's a simple answer.[ The United States is a world leader in CO2 emissions](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18512804/climate-change-united-states-china-emissions). And after ten years of decline in emissions levels from 2005 to 2015, United States emissions aren’t decreasing at the rate they need to be, and have either plateaued or increased. Without a full reaction to Climate Change in the United States, full efforts around the world would be much less effective as we continue to cloud our judgement with the haze of fossil fuels.

But again- where does the 2020 Presidential Election play into this? 

Look.[ Clearly, we can't rely on Congress](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=E01++). Many of its members- and key ones, too- take payments from Big Oil and Fossil Fuel corporations that impede progress. Members of the Senate and House have been corrupted by these corporations,[ through lobbying](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/fossil-fuel-interests-have-outspent-environmental-advocates-101-on-climate-lobbying) and direct payments. It’s a shocking, sad reality- but money has taken priority over human lives and the future of our world as a whole. Also, AOC’s [‘Green New Deal’ didn’t even get through the Senate](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-fails-advance-green-new-deal-democrats-protest-mcconnell-sham-n987506) (not that that was a surprise). What’s needed is the House and Senate to be in control of the Democratic Party- then clearly, a Green New Deal could be passed. As Robinson Meyer, a writer for The Atlantic who covers climate change stated, “Every additional Senate seat that Democrats take in 2020 could help them pass a Green New Deal. Sudden demographic change—such as a surge in enthusiasm among young voters—could push electoral math in Democrats’ direction.” [But that is far from a guarantee, even if it is possible](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/green-new-deal-why-democrats-will-struggle/581245/). With that in mind, a Democratic President who is willing to take Executive action to push Green policies into place would be needed. Why not just wait until 2024, though, if it isn’t likely pass a Green New Deal in 2020? If you’ve been paying attention, you know we are living on time we don’t have. Every day that passes digs us deeper into the climate grave we are burying ourselves in. [Any possible executive action](https://thebulletin.org/2019/03/what-could-happen-if-a-democratic-president-declared-a-national-climate-emergency/) against climate change if the Senate and House aren’t controlled by Democrats will have to be taken. It wouldn’t be pretty, but it’d be a necessary step. 

Socially, communities must understand that creating change to stop climate change doesn't come from driving an electric car, or going to the local Farmer's Market. Creating Change includes stepping up to buyback power grids from private companies that inhibit renewable energies- as we’ve seen [in Germany](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/political-breakthroughs-brighten-outlook-for-germanys-grid-expansion#gs.is6vp3) (although there have been problems- see the link). When the electricity grids are put in government control, all of a sudden the interests are put into what the people want, and not what the private shareholders want- which is obviously more money. This is happening here in the States, not just Germany- [take Boulder, Colorado as an example](https://www.dailycamera.com/2019/04/18/boulder-makes-68-5m-offer-to-acquire-xcel-energy-assets-as-it-works-toward-municipal-utility/). However, only one state in the United States has a completely publicly owned electricity sector. That state is Nebraska, where there are lower electricity rates than the national average. A greater push is needed to promote renewable energy in cities across the United States. People must decide whether climate action is important enough to them to vote in government officials who will create change- and if they do, they must go out and vote in that way! Those same people must also take part in stepping out of the fundamental free market property known as mass consumerism. I’ll let this quote from The New Republic explain it for you. 

“C40 Cities, a network of 94 of the world’s biggest cities, released a report on Wednesday estimating how much consumption habits drive the climate crisis. The results were staggering: In those nearly 100 cities, where a combined 700 million live, the consumption of goods and services “including food, clothing, aviation, electronics, construction and vehicles” is responsible for 10 percent of global greenhouse gases. That’s nearly double the emissions from every building in the entire world.”

If you connect the dots, it’s easy to tell that a much more conservative, get-what-you-need lifestyle is a necessary part to implement into every day society if we are to slow climate change at the rate it needs to be slowed. So how does that relate to the 2020 election? Well, it’s pretty easy to tell that simply asking people to travel less and consume less won’t work. People need to elect in officials that will put policies in place to create the needed lifestyle. There must be a total infrastructure redevelopment in order to make this work. That includes greatly pushing public transit, reducing urban sprawl tenfold, increasing clean water supplies, and reducing food deserts so low income and lower class people can access the resources they need. Those lower income people also need to have less financial stress too- which we could see come into play through nationwide healthcare and a flexible living wage that would be different state to state depending on what an accurate living wage is in a given state. You see, the 2020 election is going to light a path that all of our futures will take. That’s especially true for the lower class that I’ve mentioned. They are the ones who will be most greatly affected by Climate Change, and ironically, they are the least responsible for Climate Change. Those with high amounts of wealth are the ones who most directly cause Climate Change, through travel and mass consumption, among other things. That’s why political austerity and tax slashes for the rich literally need to be reversed- taxes need to be placed on the rich in order to improve life for those who are least responsible for climate change but will be most greatly affected by Climate Change. Once that is achieved, the stages of a Green New Deal can be put in place to curb climate emissions and create new jobs. That includes massive investments in building public transit, creating city wide composting systems, building more affordable housing, redesigning city layouts to be more compact, and many more options that will [create millions of jobs](https://www.sierraclub.org/trade/what-green-new-deal). This all connects back to 2020 because literally none of this can happen without communities coming out to vote for the candidates that will make this all possible. The social revolution that I have outlined can and will happen- but it all banks on you and 2020. 

Every person reading this and every person in the United States has a voice. But who’s voice is louder; the people’s, or the green bills in their pockets? Economically, money has the loudest voice in our current state. What is that current state, you may ask? Unfettered Capitalism. Around the world, free trade agreements, corporations, and political corruption influence our green future and our present society the most. Corporations and Fossil Fuel Companies are allowed to spread over the world and pump emissions into the atmosphere at catastrophic rates- a [2017 Guardian ](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change)article said that 71% of global emissions are caused by roughly 100 companies. Of those companies, fossil fuels are the worst- “ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988.” If those companies are allowed to run rampant all over the world, drilling oil and making billions while guaranteeing the deaths of millions, than we have slammed the door on our already closing coffin. But if a step away from unfettered capitalism is made towards a more government regulated business sector that removes the ability of corporations to lobby and places strict environmental restrictions on those corporations, then there is hope. Free trade agreements also greatly inhibit efforts to stop climate change, and they must be restructured in order to save the planet. Naomi Klein, author of ‘This Changes Everything (:) Capitalism vs The Climate’ stated, “As the free trade system was put in place and producing offshore became the rule, emissions did more than move- they multiplied.” Trade agreements are severely lacking in environmental regulations- and the Behemoth of trade agreements, the WTO, is the worst of them all. [Their website even says the following](https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/bey2_e.htm): “The WTO has no specific agreement dealing with the environment.”  They even go further to say, “...the removal of trade restrictions and distortions can yield benefits both for the multilateral trading system and the environment.” These are just two among many environmental hypocrisies you can find on their site that I linked in above. [Green protectionism](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/envir_e/envir_req_e.htm) is a particularly fun one that inhibits local renewable energy efforts. Clearly, that’s barely brushing the surface but I do believe you see the point I’m trying to make; Unfettered Capitalism must be stopped in order to save our planet. The 2020 Election is the time for us to step up and vote in a leader who will see these problems and make the needed moves. 

All of these changes are possible! That much is clear. 

Yet here we are,[ pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2018/06/01/one-year-since-trumps-withdrawal-from-the-paris-climate-agreement/) (Which isn't enough, by the way) and[ pushing billions of dollars into the fossil fuel industry through government subsidies.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/30/america-spends-over-20bn-per-year-on-fossil-fuel-subsidies-abolish-them)

It's clear that the Trump administration isn't going to do anything to stop Climate Change- as I've helped illustrate, they encourage it. So when 2020 rolls around, GO VOTE. Vote for our future, and vote for our planet. I’ll never force on you who to vote for- but I’ll tell you one thing. The candidate I want to win? He’s not favored to win because of ‘electability’. :).

Most people drink cow milk and consume dairy products without considering the conditions cows go through to produce milk for human consumption. I too am guilty of consuming dairy products obliviously. The cruelty in dairy farming is something I only recently became aware of. After learning more about dairy farming, I told my friends about some of the things I learned, and they were just as shocked about dairy farm conditions as I was. Not enough people know about dairy farms and eat dairy without knowing the effects dairy consumption can have. 

The conditions cows live in on dairy farms are unsanitary and cruel. At fifteen months of age, dairy cows are artificially inseminated and begin a cycle of endless impregnation and lactation (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”).  To increase profit from the animals, farmers regularly inject hormones into the animals to unnaturally speed up the gestation process (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”). Dairy cows are milked two to three times a day by heavy machinery that can be painful and cause infections to the animals (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”). All of the unnatural conditions dairy cows go through during the production of dairy shortens their lifespan. The natural lifespan of cows is twenty to twenty-five years long. The lifespan of cows in dairy production is typically four to five years, making up about 20% of what the natural cow lifespan is (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”). Many people are not aware of the damage that is done to cows during the forced production of milk.

Human consumption of dairy products has resulted in dairy farms taking advantage of animals for profit. Conditions of dairy farms and unjust treatment of animals on dairy farms can improve if humans consumed less cow milk. Human consumption of cow milk is unnatural, the human body is not biologically fit to consume cow milk (“Is Drinking Milk”;Wiley, “Cow Milk”). The human body naturally stops producing lactase (an enzyme that breaks down lactose in milk) in middle childhood (Wiley, “Cow Milk”). Most humans cannot consume dairy without having digestion issues after middle childhood (Wiley, “Cow Milk”). Cow milk is a good source of Calcium and Vitamin D, but the consumption of cow milk has no direct health benefit for humans that we can’t receive through other plant-based foods such as soy milk (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”;“Is Drinking Milk”;“18 Non-Dairy”). Soy milk is a plant-based food that essentially has the same health benefits as cow milk. Soy milk contains the same amount of calcium as cow milk and is also a good source of Vitamin D (“18 Non-Dairy”). Some other foods that offer the same health benefits as cow milk are kale, broccoli, chia seeds, almonds, and figs (“18 Non-Dairy”). By switching to other dairy alternatives, like almond or oat milk, we can greatly reduce the negative impact humans contribute to the dairy farming practice. The torture and bad conditions that cows face to produce milk for human consumption is an issue that doesn’t get enough attention. I encourage you to share this information with your friends and help bring awareness to the poor conditions of dairy farms.

False,A new approach to educating people to help the environment,"Hello everyone!

I'm Jack and I'm setting up a new non-profit organization focused on bringing awareness and educating people about how what they choose to eat affects the environment.

The focus is to try and bring people to consume less meat and other specific foods harmful to the environment (in how they are produced) by debunking myths and presenting research backed facts, answering questions, and providing accessible alternatives.

The method won't be based around convincing by force or playing on emotions like it is currently popular with vegan protesters, but rather to provide a friendly environment with an active discussion, and also to give access to compiled reader-friendly source of information in the form of a website, with links to all relevant research to back claims.

Our main activity would be to put up posters linking to our website, set up classes in schools to educate, and public presentations to raise awareness. 

No one will be portrayed as ""bad"" or ""cruel"", or discriminated in any way. The point is to educate.

Now why am I posting here? While we do have many bases covered in regards to meat consumption and know the answer to many questions, there are certainly many questions that people may ask that we missed, and we want to be sure to do proper research on all possible aspects of this topic.

So please, if you can think of any cons\downsides to moving to a animal-product-free diet, put them in the comments below. It'd be great help! Anything is welcome. Please try to be on topic and be respectful to others.

Thank you!

I often hear climate change described as an apocalypse that will destroy our ability to survive. The experience of the three countries in this podcast suggests it is possible to adapt to climate change. However, not all places have institutions as adaptive as those of South Africa and Bangladesh, and there are limits to human ingenuity. Unless political leaders in high carbon emitting countries figure out how to curb emissions, we may discover these limits with catastrophic consequences.

False,Impact of Animal Agriculture on Global Warming,"I'm looking for feedback on this article. It'll eventually be one of the 10 key points for our Pork Boycott, so I want it to be honestly vetted by people who know something about the subject. Thanks mucho...  


The animal ag industry has redoubled their efforts to confuse us about the huge impact our meat habit has on global greenhouse gasses and global warming. But the evidence is undeniable - animal agriculture is a huge part of the global warming threat.

&#x200B;

How one calculates the impact of an industry on global warming depends on how the industry is defined. If you want to do an honest accounting, you will include all the inputs in the total contribution - both direct and indirect emmissions. If forests are cleared to graze cattle, or if corn is grown to feed hogs than obviously these are key components of animal agriculture and should be part of the total calculation. 

&#x200B;

This is precisely what the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) did when they researched the animal ag industry for their report - “Livestock’s Long Shadow” in 2006. Unfortunately they did not have comparable data on the emissions produced by other sectors, such as the transportation sector. The source for the data - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) only measured direct emissions for these sector. So, for instance, the green house gas emissions produced by smelters making the steel for the auto bodies was not part of the calculation. As a result, the UNFAO conclusion that animal agriculture contributed 18% of all global warming gasses somewhat overstated the impact of animal agriculture on climate change.

&#x200B;

Of course the meat industry was quick to point out the descrepency. And it’s not surprising that they went much further - stating the UNFAO findings were “false” and “disproven”, even though those are not correct critiques of the report. The meat industry prefers to quote the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s statistic that states animal agriculture only accounts for 3.9% of total US green house gas emmissions. But the EPA numbers dont calculate indirect factors such as the fertilizer used to grow the crops that feed the animals, or the forests cleared to graze the animals, or the trucks that carry the hogs to be slaughtered.

&#x200B;

So while the EPA numbers are accurate, they are not complete. In the EPA model the trucks used to haul hogs to slaughter would fall into the transportation sector, for example. But obviously, without the demand for meat, the trucks wouldn’t be driving hogs to market!

&#x200B;

Since then, the UNFAO released a new report with updated data that uses new guidelines from the IPCC. Sadly - for the planet as well as for the meat industry - this new report’s senior author concludes, ""The absolute volume of emissions is very similar to \[the\] 2006 \[report\], even with the revised framework,"" (1) Only the overall pre cent contribution was reduced, from 18% to 14.5%.

&#x200B;

This is not good news for the meat industry, but it is a more complete and honest accounting of meat’s impact on our planet.

&#x200B;

“All told, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with livestock supply chains add up to 7.1 gigatonnes (GT) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) per year – or 14.5 percent of all human-caused GHG releases.

&#x200B;

According to the new UNFAO report, the main sources of emissions in animal ag are: feed production and processing (45 percent of the total), outputs of GHG during digestion by cows (39 percent), and manure decomposition (10 percent). The remainder is attributable to the processing and transportation of animal products.” (2)

&#x200B;

The new figure - 14.5% - is not what the industry wanted to hear. So they are downplaying it or talking around it. Or more likely, harking back to the EPA’s smaller figure with it’s incomplete accounting.

&#x200B;

The new FAO report emphasizes the potential for animal agriculture to reduce it’s  global warming footprint. And no doubt there is huge area for improvement. But its not at all likely to happen. In areas where animal ag is big, they exert pressure on local governments to remain completely hands off. Any attempt to hold the industry accountable for the pollution, cruelty, and disease it produces is met with staunch resistance. As an example, research done at University of Iowa on voluntary efforts to reduce nutrient runoff from farm fields has shown pollution has actually increased since the voluntary program began.

&#x200B;

In fact, one thing the animal ag industry and those who study it agree on is that meat production and consumption will grow rapidly for decades to come. So the numbers they are quoting today, regardless of their source, are sure to increase. Meantime industries like transport are meeting consumer demand for more fuel efficient cars by using alternative, green technolgies. 

&#x200B;

And while consumption of meat has slowed in developed countries, the increase in meat consumption in many other areas of the world is growing rapidly. 

&#x200B;

The global impact of animal agriculture will rapidly rise if we don’t curtail our desire to consume animal flesh.

False,The True Terror of Climate Change: Part 1,"Intro:

&#x200B;

This isn’t something I take some sort of arrogant self-satisfaction in writing. In truth it is the most depressing thing I’ve ever typed out in my drawn-out youth of half-baked high-school poetry and pandering college essays. I’m writing this because I’m frustrated. I’m frustrated by a combination of two traditional narratives I often see in regards to discussing the impending ecological collapse we typically refer to as ""climate change"". The first is that there is hope to maintain the current state of things, always of the “just enough time to act” variety, and the follow-up assumption that seems to come with that is that communicating any sense of impending “doom” or “hopelessness” will dissuade people from trying to mitigate the disaster. Articles such as the following convey this attitude (and I hope to respond directly to this article soon) - [http://time.com/4731632/climate-change-2020-trump/](http://time.com/4731632/climate-change-2020-trump/)

Personally I don’t buy into either of these narratives. The following writing, however short or long it becomes, will seek to address these narratives while simultaneously revealing a more concrete truth buried within them both. 

&#x200B;

Part 1: The Problem: 

&#x200B;

Before we go into things like the politics or response efforts to climate change (and the wider issues of ecological collapse), let’s take some time to just examine the problem itself. In this section, we will look solely at the challenges facing the global atmosphere, how that ties into the biosphere, and the nature of the problems confronting both the natural world and wider human society. 

For most people, the entry point for understanding the environmental problems as a cohesive global issue comes from being introduced to climate change. The basic premise introduced is simple: humans are emitting CO2 in the form of fossil fuel consumption, that emission of CO2 is changing (warming) the climate, and that given a long enough scale, this problem will fundamentally reshape things like coastal communities or the ability to maintain agriculture.

Many see this as the end of the journey in understanding climate change. It present a clear issue, gives it a name, describes it in an elevator-speech type format, and provides a paradoxically simple yet complex solution to solving it: Humanity must emit less CO2 over time to avoid changing the climate too radically in order to maintain the status quo of the industrialized modern world. 

Unfortunately, this narrative is intensely limited. For example, it doesn’t touch on the idea that humanity emits a multitude of gasses into the atmosphere, many of which trap far more heat than CO2.

The factory farm system has added millions of bovine to the surface of the Earth that simply didn’t exist before, and the nature of decomposing societal waste in the form of landfills is also a modern creation of the past century. Both of these processes emit an enormous amount of Methane. This is important to note because Methane actually traps 100 times as much gas as CO2 in its first year of introduction, and retains roughly 72 times the amount of heat after 5 years. There is something to be said for the fact the Methane tends to dissipate from the atmosphere after 10 years, but its ability to accumulate over that time and our continued increase of its production has largely outpaced this dissipation. - [http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/) 

(how factory farming adds to climate change.) - [https://www.ecowatch.com/how-factory-farming-contributes-to-global-warming-1881690535.html](https://www.ecowatch.com/how-factory-farming-contributes-to-global-warming-1881690535.html)

Yet even with this understanding the severity of something as simple as 1 additional chemical is downplayed. Since methane tends to be seen as more of a “burst” of heating as opposed to the “sustained” heating CO2 leads to, there is an instinct to see it as less of a threat, or at least as less of an enduring one. What this ignores however is the nature of how this type of short-term burst of heating adds to the wider cycle of climate change. 

As Methane adds to the heating cycle, it gives a boost to the melting of arctic and sub-arctic permafrost in the regions of Alaska, Northern Canada, and Russia’s Siberia. This permafrost itself contains an unknowable amount of gasses, all trapped within the once permanently frozen areas of those regions. As these areas are thawed for the first time in 1000’s of years, they release the CO2 and methane stored beneath, thus accelerating the warming cycle in a way that is outside of human influence or control. The problem is pervasive enough that scientists continue to show larger-than-expected amounts of these gasses being released into the atmosphere from this process. - [https://phys.org/news/2018-03-permafrost-methane.html](https://phys.org/news/2018-03-permafrost-methane.html)

This process gives us an introduction to the wider problem of climate change, which is the nature of its intersectionality with the wider crises facing the World’s ecosystems. Still, taken in this view the common perspective often looks to the atmosphere itself as the source of both the problem and the solution. A deeper look shows how other environmental problems tie into this process. 

Let’s take de-forestation as an example. It is no surprise to anyone who passed 3rd grade science that plants take in CO2 emitted by humans and other animals, and that they in-turn release oxygen for our consumption. This understanding leads us to a natural conclusion: the more trees we have on the planet, the better we’ll be able to regulate the escalation of gasses like CO2 and Methane. Indeed, scientists have said for a long time that the global forest systems are the best means for mitigating climate change. - [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-best-technology-for-fighting-climate-change-isnt-a-technology/](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-best-technology-for-fighting-climate-change-isnt-a-technology/)

Unfortunately, looking into the rate of deforestation itself will show that we are only adding to the problem by clearing these necessary ecosystems, rather than helping to mitigate the disaster by protecting them. The amazon rainforest is perhaps the best example. Often referred to as “the world’s lungs”, it is the largest continuous area of tropical rainforest on the planet, and is responsible for 20% of all the oxygen inhaled by every living creature on the planet. 

Despite the overwhelming importance of this region, its destruction has gone largely unchecked, ironically pushed to exploit resources that add heat to the atmosphere or for the clearing of land for industrial farming. The fact that Brazil recently elected Jair Bolsonaro, a climate change denier (liar) who has promised to increase rainforest “development” and shifted control of the region from the country’s environmental agency to its agricultural one, shows that this problem has little chance of slowing. - [http://www.humanosphere.org/environment/2016/07/brazils-rising-deforestation-rate-shows-reversal-environmental-progress/](http://www.humanosphere.org/environment/2016/07/brazils-rising-deforestation-rate-shows-reversal-environmental-progress/)

(Bolsonaro transfers power over the rainforest to agricultural ministry.) - [https://www.agcanada.com/daily/bolsonaro-gives-brazil-farm-ministry-powers-on-indigenous-land](https://www.agcanada.com/daily/bolsonaro-gives-brazil-farm-ministry-powers-on-indigenous-land)

One could be forgiven for hoping that forest protection efforts or re-forestation efforts might help make up some of this difference. Depressingly though, this is not the case. The largest bio-spheres of the planet with the largest areas of forest cover have experienced massive forest lost since 2001 alone. The Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, lost 12 million hectares of forest cover in that 16 year period, with their single highest year of loss being 2017 itself at 1,470,000 hectares in a single year. For perspective, the total area of Michigan is 25,049,329 hectares. This means that the Democratic Republic of Congo alone has cleared an area of forest almost half the size of the entire state of Michigan in less time than it takes a human being to go from infancy to high-school graduation. Taken in conjunction with forest loss in other countries, the situation’s urgency begins to reveal itself. - [https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map) 

Still, not even this combination of factors is able to show the true all-encompassing nature of the environmental catastrophe we now find ourselves living through. To gain a wider picture of the problem, we should look beyond our own visible atmosphere and turn to the other 2/3rds of our planet: The Oceans. 

The World’s oceans absorb 35 - 42% of all CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, and over 90% of the excess heat caused by global warming. Their importance in mitigating and understanding climate change, and the nature of change that the warming climate will have on these ecosystems, cannot be understated. - [https://www.climatechangenews.com/2012/01/24/warming-oceans-face-co2-tipping-point/](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2012/01/24/warming-oceans-face-co2-tipping-point/)

This absorption has already begun to affect the oceans, despite the system taking about 20 - 40 years to fully react to the change. This delayed reaction means that, even if humans were to discontinue all CO2 emission today, the oceans would continue to change as a result of global warming for decades beyond that end. This is known as “The thermal intertia of the oceans.” - [https://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html](https://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html)

The nature of the change which has already taken place has been massively negative. Coral reefs have begun bleaching far more often than in previous decades. While bleaching events are a natural process, their increased rate means the reefs don’t have time to recover as part of the natural cycle, leading to massive die-offs of these “underwater forests” from regions such as the Great Barrier Reef. Naturally, this destruction removes sources of food for important parts of the marine ecosystem and adds to the global ecosystem’s inability to effectively react to industrial human activity. - [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/08/explore-atlas-great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-map-climate-change/](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/08/explore-atlas-great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-map-climate-change/)

While the death of massive amounts of marine life is obviously catastrophic for both the planet and our dependence on the Oceans, it’s not even the only story tied into the Oceans when it comes to climate change. Another effect is seen when we look at ocean currents, which are slowing and causing changes to weather patterns already. Indeed, global climate scientists have begun to ask whether the entire Ocean current system could “stall.” Since these currents help to power and carry everything from necessary rain patterns to hurricanes and cyclones, a change in these systems would have massive effects on human life. In fact, when hurricane Harvey hit Texas in 2017, the national weather service had to add a new color to their radar mapping system simply so they could accurately track the amount of water being dumped on the State. They had never needed to measure rain in that amount in that region in the modern history of weather analysis. - [https://e360.yale.edu/features/will\_climate\_change\_jam\_the\_global\_ocean\_conveyor\_belt](https://e360.yale.edu/features/will_climate_change_jam_the_global_ocean_conveyor_belt)

Hurricane Harvey color added: - [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546776542/national-weather-service-adds-new-colors-so-it-can-map-harveys-rains](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546776542/national-weather-service-adds-new-colors-so-it-can-map-harveys-rains)

Taken in conjunction with these problems, let’s finish by looking at how climate change can affect global weather patterns. While the hurricane example above is a good example to show how the change in the oceans from climate change helps propel a change in the weather, even this link is not a full view of the intersectionality which climate change represents. 

Perhaps the greatest immediate threat some developing countries will experience as climate change progresses isn’t the flooding of coastal cities, but rather the restriction or even complete eradication of water sources and localized water cycles. Many nations hosting millions of people rely heavily on localized water cycles for their populations. Pakistan, for example, requires snowfall in its northern region during the winter months in order to maintain its water usage, since the melting of this snow in those same mountain regions leads to massive water runoff which itself adds to and becomes the country’s rivers. - [http://glacierhub.org/2018/02/15/glacial-retreat-water-impacts/](http://glacierhub.org/2018/02/15/glacial-retreat-water-impacts/) 

This means that, should those regions warm to a point where that snowfall is extremely hindered or halted all together (as is widely predicted), the country would be left with an unknowable loss in water supply for its population of millions. Add to this the prediction that overall rainfall throughout the country is expected to decrease simultaneously with this loss of the glacial melting cycle, and you begin to paint a painfully dire portrait. - [https://www.geo.tv/latest/144615-pakistan-facing-worst-effects-of-climate-change](https://www.geo.tv/latest/144615-pakistan-facing-worst-effects-of-climate-change)

More on Pakistan: - [https://tribune.com.pk/story/682012/impact-of-climate-change-in-pakistan/](https://tribune.com.pk/story/682012/impact-of-climate-change-in-pakistan/)

This combination of diminishing rainfall and glacial runoff isn’t unique to Pakistan. India, the world’s most populous nation, is expected to feel many of the same effects. Additionally, the major rivers leading into China and Southeast Asia are largely sourced from Tibet and the Himalayas, an area of incredibly high mountains and sprawling natural glaciers. The Mekong river, the Yangtze, and many others find their source in this central region of the Asian continent. Yet the fate of those rivers and their water sources are cast into doubt as climate change hammers away at Tibet and drains the region of this naturally recurring and utterly necessary cycle. - [https://tibet-edd.blogspot.com/2012/03/tibet-and-climate-change-whats.html](https://tibet-edd.blogspot.com/2012/03/tibet-and-climate-change-whats.html) 

So where does that leave us? Well, hopefully this shows the impending nature of the climate catastrophe. Climate Change is not some vague idea or one that has limited effects, it is both propelled by and propelling countless other changes within systems that are vital to both human and ecological survival. Failing to understand the grand nature of this problem, its immediacy, and it intersectional elements has allowed cognitive dissonance around the issue to flourish. In order to move forward with even the most basic amount of optimism, we must confront the reality of what is happening, rather than seeking to downplay it in order to attract wider attention to the issue.

This urgency should be the engine to gain that wider attention.

Water shortages could affect 5bn people by 2050, UN report warns

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/19/water-shortages-could-affect-5bn-people-by-2050-un-report-warns


By 2020 about 30-40% of the world will have water scarcity, and according to the researchers, climate change can make this even worse.

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140729093112.htm

With only 7% of the world’s freshwater, China plans to produce 807 million gallons a day from desalination by 2020, roughly quadruple the country’s current capacity.

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-09/china-embraces-desalination-to-ease-water-shortages

By 2025, an estimated 1.8 billion people will live in areas plagued by water scarcity, with two-thirds of the world’s population living in water-stressed regions.

http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/freshwater/freshwater-crisis/ 

There will be about 1 billion more mouths to feed worldwide by 2025 and global agriculture alone will require another 1 trillion cubic meters of water per year (equal to the annual flow of 20 Niles or 100 Colorado Rivers).

http://www.interactioncouncil.org/world-confronts-serious-water-crisis-former-heads-government-and-experts-warn-new-report

UN studies project that 30 nations will be water scarce in 2025, up from 20 in 1990.

According to the U.S. Intelligence Community Assessment of Global Water Security, by 2030 humanity’s “annual global water requirements” will exceed “current sustainable water supplies” by 40%.

http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/05/the-coming-global-water-crisis/256896/

Water demand in India will reach 1.5 trillion cubic meters in 2030 while India’s current water supply is only 740 billion cubic meters.

http://www.mckinsey.com/client_service/sustainability/latest_thinking/charting_our_water_future

If current usage trends don’t change, the world will have only 60 percent of the water it needs in 2030.

http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/03/20/world/asia/ap-world-water-crisis.html?_r=0

By 2035, the world’s energy consumption will increase by 35 percent, which in turn will increase water use by 15 percent according to the International Energy Agency.

http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/01/16/will-water-constrain-our-energy-future

By the year 2040 there will not be enough water in the world to quench the thirst of the world population and keep the current energy and power solutions going if we continue doing what we are doing today.

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140729093112.htm

The number of people living in river basins under severe water stress is projected to reach 3.9 billion by 2050, totaling over 40% of the world’s population.

False,I've lost hope. I'm giving up on change and going into survival mode,"Apologies if this doesn't fit this sub. It's my first time posting here. This will be a bit of a rant.

A paragraph I read on Reddit recently really hit home for me:

>I listen to conversations around me at work on mondays to hear what people around me feel is important that happened over the weekend. Mostly personal stuff or hockey, then maybe celebrity gossip or something about the weather. Very rarely politics or about the economy, and only if affects them. I’m just sitting there thinking, “we’re living through a mass extinction and our grandchildren probably won’t survive the effects of man made climate change that are going to hit this century.” I feel such a cognitive dissonance with everyone around me. It’s surreal. - u/OptimisticViolence

A conversation with a colleague two weeks ago may have been the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. Over lunch, he pointed out again (again, again) that I wasn't eating any meat, and smilingly added that his family had just started meatless Thursday dinners because of climate change.

Same day, in the evening, I heard a radio program with a woman talking about reducing consumption for Christmas, and using wrapping paper twice.

""What's the issue?"" you're maybe thinking. ""Those sound like positive small steps."" Yes, they do. *Small* steps. I hear those people talking as if their ""sacrifices"" are what is necessary to ""save the planet"", then I read an article about coral bleaching or 5 degree shifts or mass extinctions or the Clathrate gun and I just want to scream. The disconnect from reality just seems so utterly impossible to reconcile that I don't know what to do.

And those small steps are some of the *good* things. We currently have world leaders and industry leaders denying climate change is even a thing, or simply ignoring its effects in order to focus on profits. Closer to home, I see Christmas crap being thrown out from stores and people going about their daily lives, driving to work, chowing down on roast pork, taking advantage of sales. *So few people are truly worried.*

I've been a vegetarian for over 20 years. The only thing I buy for myself new is food. I haven't flown in nearly 5 years. I rarely drive. But I live in a relatively cold climate in a heated house with my family, a house that is likely much larger than we truly need. Our food often comes wrapped in plastic. My house needs to be maintained. My kids use school supplies. I'm using a computer right now. Nobody is perfect, but I'm not naive enough to think that everyone is willing to make even the sacrifices I've made. And guess what - *even that wouldn't be enough*.

So I give up.

I think human greed and selfishness, basically human nature, will win over all the pragmatists telling us to ditch meat and our cars while trying to implement carbon credits. Polluters gonna pollute. Most people won't care until they are choking. I just don't see a realistic scenario where everything turns out OK. A miraculous new source of infinite clean energy? Great, we'll just use more of it. Cloud seeding or other crazy solutions? I honestly don't think we're close to ready to try those solutions without serious risk of creating an uninhabitable planet. Maybe we'll be more desperate soon.

So what to do now? I've been tossing around ideas with my wife over the holidays. Maybe emigrate to New Zealand or Canada. Buy a big chunk of land at least 100km from a big city. Teach our kids things like beekeeping, canning and water purification rather than violin lessons or handball. Quit our jobs (our cost of living can be ridiculously low out there). Basically go into survival mode while I'm young enough (42) to still do so, and to be able to teach my kids useful skills before shit really hits the fan (and I believe it will). 

Because *yes*, even here in a developed country I'm sure we'll be affected. First we'll see a few years of bad storms and hunger in underdeveloped and developing countries (hell, we're already seeing this). We'll break heat records. We'll see food prices rise. Probably soldiers protecting Europe's borders before long from more and more refugees (I believe what we've seen from Syria is a drop in the coming bucket). But eventually it will start to affect our daily lives for real. At that point, I wonder what happens to my smiling colleague and his meatless Thursday dinners. Nobody is ready for what's coming.

Dear Fellow Overwhelmed Earth Lovers,

In the past two years, I traveled to several beautiful countries including Costa Rica, Argentina, Italy and Spain, and have been lucky enough to experience the pristine, breathtaking beaches they possess. However, I noticed these scenic landscapes had one thing in common: plastic pollution. After returning from these trips, I became inspired to monitor my plastic consumption and to research sustainable alternatives to everyday plastic products.  

As a California native and a concerned citizen of the earth, I am very familiar with the hold that plastic has on society and, quite frankly, my dependence on this troublesome industrial good. Of course we would love to see the earth change for the better, however, I would even go as far to say that plastic is a beloved part of our lives even though we know that it is hurting our environment on almost every level. Letting go of plastic is difficult. I myself find it hard to imagine my life without plastic, the cleaning and upkeep of reusable products honestly seems exhausting. So, I understand that we will not solve this plastic invasion anytime soon due to the majority of the population’s stubbornness and convenient naivety. However, we can start making small changes that have large impacts on our prolonged quality of air, water, and general life on this planet. **📷**

I began thinking about what areas of my life had become dependent on plastic and I found that it was pretty much every area. After, witnessing such undeniable proof that my use of plastic is harming animals and ruining the beautiful landscapes I love to admire, I then researched a bit more and found that there are sustainable, [reusable alternatives](https://packagefreeshop.com/) to almost all of these products. Even toothbrushes!

The thing about plastic is that single use items are easy, and we love ease. Throwing away plastic water bottles instead of carrying a metal one around with you is so much more convenient. Using a plastic straw as opposed to a soggy paper straw, or a metal straw that you have to wash, is much less work.  50% of the plastic we consume, we use once and throw away and the [average American throws away 185 pounds of plastic per year](https://www.ecowatch.com/22-facts-about-plastic-pollution-and-10-things-we-can-do-about-it-1881885971.html). We use plastic products because we don’t have to think about them when we are done with them. We throw the water bottle away and never look back. However, this can only go on so long until the ghosts of plastic’s past show up on our favorite beaches, along the paths of our favorite walks, and in the tummy’s of our favorite animals. 

While plastic may be versatile, durable, cheap to produce, and convenient for a disposable lifestyle, we need to be more conscious of the effects our convenient purchases have on our planet and consider sustainable alternatives. 

I take a step back and think about how much plastic is involved in my everyday life and it’s a shit ton. From the plastic packaging of my mail, to the plastic encasing of my food, and even down to my plastic toothbrush, I feel as if I am surrounded by plastics in different disguises. However, the fact that plastic is literally everywhere gives us more opportunities to make sustainable changes.

**📷**

I know many of us, especially in California, have already switched over to reusable bags and have bought reusable water bottles that attend every outing with us. These small changes are able to have an enormous impact when we consider that we no longer contribute to the nearly two million single use plastic bags or the one million plastic bottles distributed every minute worldwide. After only a year of the implementation of the statewide plastic bag ban in California, data from the 2017 annual coastal cleanup showed a 72% decrease in plastic bag litter compared to 2010. In reaction to this data, if we already use a reusable water bottle and a reusable bag, what’s the harm in using a [wooden toothbrush](https://packagefreeshop.com/collections/bathroom/products/bamboo-toothbrush-adult) or [hairbrush](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Brush-Wooden-Bristles-Massage/dp/B01NCM1VQA)? How about a [cotton produce bag](https://www.organiccottonmart.com/products/organic-cotton-mesh-produce-bags?gclid=CjwKCAjw0oveBRAmEiwAzf6_rG-2Gkt9VvwtHvOwqXviVWZXDRFz__ceMFpdhxxXvQEIKUFYw7gQZxoC0ckQAvD_BwE)? Or a [metal food container](https://packagefreeshop.com/collections/kitchen/products/food-container) instead of a ziploc? Imagine how much the plastic pollution percentage would decrease in the next 7 years!

It is time to get serious about making these changes. A study showed that about 93% of Americans age 6 or older tested positive for BPA, a plastic chemical that interferes with our hormones. Plastic is now not only hurting our planet, but [the chemicals are hurting us](https://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/health/case_studies/plastics.html). The hardest part in switching from a plastic product to a reusable product is actually committing to making the switch. Yes, reusable products may take more effort. Yes, you might have to clean the cotton produce bag once a while. Yes, you might have to spend a little bit more money up front for a reusable water bottle. However, these products seem worth it when you consider that if we continue the way we are now, plastic pollution will outweigh fish pound for pound by 2050. 

Should you go looking into sustainable alternatives, be proud that you are even considering making these changes. You may inspire someone else to do the same thing and that’s exactly how we are going to get back to the point where there are more stars in the sky than plastic pieces in the sea. The payoff is a healthier world for you and your loved ones, for your pets and your favorite animals, and for the future inhabitants of this earth to live in and to explore.

False,What is the best way to offset the negative externalities from by beef (aside from asking people to abstain from beef)?,"Hi r/environment!

&#x200B;

I own a restaurant and we're always looking for ways to make our products and processes more sustainable. (Recycling, using recycled packaging, biodegradable utensils / straws, etc.) As I expand the business I'm considering pivoting our model and implementing a social cause. This would be similar to Tom's shoes, which, for every pair of shoes purchased donates a pair of shoes to a person in need, only our cause would be related to curbing the negative environmental impact imposed by beef.

&#x200B;

As you may know, the methane off-put from cattle is detrimental to our atmosphere, as cows require substantial land and water use. Hamburgers are a popular item on our menu and though we already offer several vegan ""garden burger"" options, we'll also be offering a plant-based meat (Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods) option to appeal to meat-lovers who want to reduce their meat consumption. 

&#x200B;

Still, we want to do more. We recognize that asking Americans to abstain from eating beef is unrealistic, so we'll still offer beef patties. That said, we'd like to use the customer's experience to educate and leave them feeling empowered and with a clearer conscience as a result of choosing to dine with us. How? Because they'll know a portion of profits in this new social-cause approach. So, we're looking for an effort or non-profit organization which mitigates the impact we're having by selling beef. 

&#x200B;

**This leads me to my question:** As a business pledging an on-going contribution, what would be a worthwhile effort or NPO we could donate to which is involved in efforts to help offset some of the same negative externalities from beef? 

&#x200B;

My initial thought was to pledge 50% of corporate profits to land conservation NPOs. These organizations purchase development rights from private individuals who own precious lands important to historical or environmentally threatened habitats. (Replacing native plants and animal habitats with pavement/development is another way in which we contribute to climate change.)

&#x200B;

That said, I'm wondering if there's a better use of these funds which would have a bigger impact? In other words, we're looking to implement a self-imposed, backend carbon tax on our profits (no increase to the price of the product) to help curb the destructive, resource-intensive aspects associated with our most popular product.

&#x200B;

 I made a post a few days ago which got some good feedback, but I worry was too long and complicated.  I'm hoping this more-concise post will garner more feedback. Thanks for your time!",Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability,Disgust (Negative)

By 2025, cars will cause about 1 Gig of data traffic per day.

By 2050, air-conditioning alone will use 100% of our renewable energy.

We now use more energy for less payback fracking, while conventional fields run dry. 

Runaway hothouse gets triggered between 1.5-2.0 C, and those are our aspirational goals.

We are repeatedly told these goals are scientific, they're not.

300 ppm of C02 is safe, 408 is not. We can't fool our way out of this. It's not political, it's reality.

False,Why soybean producers don’t want consumers to eat... soy,"For soybean producers it is much more lucrative to sell their crop to the animal farming industry than to producers of soy-based food for human consumption. As The Humane Society’s Paul Shapiro writes in his 2018 book Clean Meat, “Ironically, the last thing soy producers want is for Americans to shift from meat to soy products like tofu and edamame, since the latter requires so much less soy.”

False,Is Palm Oil Destroying the Planet?,"Almost every product in the grocery store contains some palm oil. It can be found in bread, instant noodles, shampoo, chocolate and many others. It is omnipresent in processed foods, but has also been reviled as an agent of global warming and ecological damage. Every year, Singapore and other cities throughout South East Asia are blanketed with smog as palm oil as an immense acreage of forest is burnt to clear land for the expansion of palm oil plantations. Orangutans and other rain forest species are at the brink of extinction as more and more land is cleared for palm oil plantations and logging. Perhaps, most disturbingly, palm oil production is a major culprit in rising carbon output. Much of the expansion of palm oil production happens over peat lands, which have more than 15 times as much carbon trapped as other tropical rain forest. Change of tropical land use accounts for 15 &#37; of global carbon emissions, and palm oil is one of the biggest drivers of this process.

However, palm oil is more than just an environmental threat. Millions of farmers, whether as workers in large plantations or as smallholders, in Indonesia, Malaysia, and other nations in South East Asia depend upon palm oil for their livelihoods. Palm oil dominates the economies of key palm oil growing regions such as northern Sumatra. However, it is important not to think of palm oil as a monolith when it comes to it’s environmental impact. Palm oil requires only a quarter of the land that alternatives to palm oil require. While clearing peat bogs for palm oil is environmentally disastrous, palm oil production on established farm land isn’t unusually ecologically damaging. Smallholders rarely clear land for new plantations, and are much less damaging to the environment than the “slash and burn” techniques used by many larger plantations.

In theory it should be possible to consume palm oil produced with sustainable methods and processes such as GreenPalm and the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) aim to ensure only sustainable palm oil is produced . However, the palm oil supply chain is immensely complex and the overwhelming majority of palm oil consumption occurs in developing where supply chains management is even more difficult. Solving the problem of the ecological harm of palm oil production is a lot more complicated than simply boycotting products with palm oil.

Humans waste 50% of food.

Over the next 30 years, electric cars will reduce emissions 0.5% and oil will still be used for 80% of vehicles.

Emissions must go down 100% in 20 years or billions will die.

We only have a 5% chance of succeeding.

If we stop eating meat, stop throwing away food, and reduce our energy use 50%, we could save life on earth. And you know damn well that is not going to happen.

To avoid 2° C, fossil emissions must go down 100% in 2 decades says Stefan Rahmstorf.

The news by fracking scientist, Dr. Ingraffea, means emissions now have to go down 100% in 10 years!

Kevin Anderson says we have a 5% chance of staying below 2° C.

This means we have 95% chance of not avoiding disaster in 10-20 years.

False,The hard road ahead: What happens in the coming years of this planet...,"This is what I see going forward. Let me know what you think.

Polar sea ice gone by 2020 to 2025. I don’t think a blue water Arctic is the end. It will be a harbinger. With the loss of the albedo effect from sea ice, temperature rises will be more stark. Frozen carbon and methane trapped in shallow Arctic seabeds and Arctic region permafrost - already bubbling and off-gassing from tens of thousands of sites - will see dramatic increases release into the atmosphere. There is double the greenhouse gasses trapped in the Arctic. The polar vortex will become even more destabilized and may break down. Major weather extremes will pick up frequency, devastating infrastructure and agriculture.

Our growing hungry and desperate populations - estimated to hit 10 billion by 2050 - will accelerate deforestation, habitat destruction, poaching and encroaching. They have to, because the Earth is losing arable land to salinization (from irrigation, sea level rises and storm surges), water erosion, depletion of fertility, windblown topsoil loss exacerbated by tilling, etc. Global meat consumption continues to rise, thanks to emerging nations’ prosperity, requiring even more fields to be cleared to grow food for livestock. (Sorry, vegans, hope doesn’t change billions of diets overnight. Your best efforts and comments, videos, books, presentations, graphic images of factory farming, etc. over the past several decades have not slowed consumption).

Greenland’s already “faster than expected” melt will accelerate even more dramatically once a blue water Arctic becomes reality, as sea water there heats up. World sea levels will see truly noticeable rises from that. The giant kilometer-thick ice of Antarctica will still be there. Though that, too, will be picking up calving and melting acceleration. It may take a few decades or more for Antarctica’s ice to go, but serious sea level rises will mean tens of thousands of human cities (including garbage dumps and hundreds of nuclear power plants) will be inundated, especially by king tides and storm surges. (You will not want to be living near the ocean in a few years’ time.)

Even as that occurs, the cumulative acidification and warming of the oceans will pick up. Already, plankton, mollusks, coral, etc. and other creatures at the base are stressed and experiencing difficulties, as per this article. The bottom of the food chain and oxygen generation (ocean phytoplankton generate half the oxygen on this planet) will fall out - even as fleets of desperate trawlers and millions of fishermen seek to pillage even more from collapsed stocks.

Animals are disappearing in palpable numbers. To support humanity’s increase from 4 billion to almost 7.6 billion (including our ecological footprint), over half of all animals (terrestrial and marine) had to die. Yet the rates of deforestation and desertification have increased, not decreased. Species are disappearing in at a frenzied pace. Overall ecological and environmental collapse has become really noticeable lately. It will be even more noticeable going forward. Rhinos, elephants, giraffes, orangutans, tigers, etc. will be gone from the wild.

Perhaps enough of us humans will realize our folly once we are no longer able to insulate ourselves from the consequences of our actions. By then, however, it will have been too little, too late...

When you think about it, we are on a massive ship with a small engine. It takes decades to get up to speed; we’ve had a few centuries. Even small course corrections take decades to begin, decades to implement, and decades to begin seeing real results. To make changes in time, we needed to have started decades ago: strict laws on extraction, production, consumption, reproduction, pollution, and disposition. None of it has happened. In fact, the bridge has ordered the ship’s engine room to increase power to the thrusters. The wheel is locked on course.

False,Making a video about environmental effects of the over-consumption.,"Hello, as the title says, I'm in the progess of making a video about environmental changes and the over-consumption of North Americans and the impacts. The video is purposely made to inform and provoke people.

The reason why I am making a thread is that I need your help. I need actual footage of certain things to fit my planning.

Things that could really help me :

A commercial of Popsicle or something similar with a kid eating a popsicle while smiling. 

A plastic bag stuck in a tree, maybe with birds around it or trapped in it.

A family dinner showing unreasonnable amount of food

A clip showing a plate full of food being thrown out in the garbage bin

I'm hoping to find videos or docs that paint a clear picture of the interconnectedness of the demand/ supply chain with all of the potential and inevitable human and environmental costs involved in allowing such a system to flourish by being enablers and out-of-sight-out-of-minders with our obliviousness, careless demands, marketing manipulated 'needs'/ desires/ standards and consumption habits, etc.

False,Could we replace fossil fuel with wood?,"If we suppose that in the future meat will be produced industrially we can imagine that hundred of thousand square km will no longer be used(according to Wikipedia ""Permanent pastures are 68.4% of all agricultural land (26.3% of global land area)[...] total of land used to produce food: 49,116,227 square kilometers""  (1)).

We can imagine that this newly freed land could be use for other purposes.

Suppose this new land is used to grow corn( corn because I can reliably say how much 1 square meter can produce(2), it could be used any other plant), the final product could be burned as an alternative fuel in power plants.

Doing some calculation the resulting energy could be comparable( if not greater) to the current global energy consumption( 5.67 × 1020 joules (3)).


Calc:

TLL > Total Land used for Livestock --> 3.3 * 10^13 m^2

WpSm > Wood produced per square meter --> 6,200 lbm/ac (2)(in the civilized world 0.69 kg/m^2) 

EpKg > Engergy of wood per kg  --> 1.62 * 10^7 J/kg (4)

TEP > total energy produced

TEP is simply

TEP = TLL* WpSm * EpKg = 3.3 * 10^20 J


Therefore the energy production calculated is comparable to the actual production.

Finally we have to acknowledge that we underestimated the Wood production per square meter having taken only into consideration corn and with the right crop we could reach realistically 10 kg/m^2* year.





P.S: the basic idea is a 3.3 * 10^13 m^2 solar panel

“Water security is one of the most tangible and fastest growing social, political and economic challenge faced today.”
World Economic Forum (2016)


1. Water Risks is an Increasing Concern 
By 2050, the world’s population is expected to reach 9.7 billion. It will be 11 billion by 2100. All these people will need water to meet their most basic needs. Agriculture, industry and domestic life rely on the abundant supply of safe water. However, this is by no means guaranteed and unpredictable water quality and availability represent one of the decade’s top emerging risks. 
Freshwater risk management is complex to assess. Such difficulty stems from the paradoxical nature of water: it is plentiful to many yet its scarcity affects hundreds of millions of people, it is both fossil and renewable, it is freely supplied by nature but its treatment, distribution, and wastage have a cost. 
Water risks are often underestimated, disregarded or simply ignored. This results in a global lack of preparation for future impacts and has implications for the world’s population, as a majority of water risks represent externalities which are not properly assessed. Consequently, all research and reports identified future concerns, especially in the following areas: 
■ World population will have to respond to a growing frequency and severity of losses; 
■ Awareness levels could be improved and drinking water will have a role in increasing understanding; 
■ The World need significant innovation in drinking water by directing big investments into innovative projects, technologies, and asset lines. 
■ The difficulty to assess future water risks is emphasized by the advent of new technologies and big infrastructure projects the eventual effects of which are as yet unclear.


2. What Are the Risks? 
A number of water risks are considered in this paper, including the impact of scarcity, pollution, water-related illnesses, treatment and topics of social, political and economic interests. 
Natural resources are unequally distributed around the world. Physical water scarcity, or the literal lack of water, is gradually worsening in many areas. Economic water scarcity from lack of finance or inadequate water management will lead to the rapid depletion of usable water resources. Such shortages will inevitably have implications for a wide range of insurance lines of business: property, agriculture, casualty, life, and health.
Ensuring clean water supply is a key to socioeconomic development. A failure to deliver or maintain a clean water supply can be inhibiting for any society. Many emerging countries are less capable of treating their water due to insufficient economic means. Water treatment in developed countries is subject to increasingly stringent regulations and quality standards to address pollution. Furthermore, treatment plants are considered as critical infrastructure that can potentially disseminate toxic products on a large scale as a result of human error or terrorist attack. Such a large scale event in a major city could seriously impact the world’s population.


3. Water is plentiful on earth, yet scarcity affects hundreds of million people worldwide.
Only 3% of global water resources are in the form of freshwater (in glaciers, ice caps, groundwater, lakes, soils, rivers, atmosphere and within living organisms); 97% is salt water in the oceans. Humanity does not lack water as such but faces shortages of fresh water readily available for consumption. This is aggravated by uneven geographical distribution, erratic supplies, and evolving trends in worldwide water patterns. 

4. Water resources: both fossil and renewable
Water moves continuously between different reservoirs, following a natural hydrological cycle. The turnaround time of water is about 10 days in the atmosphere and a few weeks in rivers, which makes it effectively renewable. On the contrary, water replacement in deep aquifers can last for hundreds to thousands of years: it is a non-renewable fossil resource (like oil) when withdrawals exceed the annual recharge. The increasing human demand gradually takes its toll on fossil water, some resources are already depleted at rates far superior to their replacement times. 

5. Water is free, but treatment, distribution, and mismanagement have a cost
Access to water from rivers, wells or dedicated infrastructures is generally free but this water is often unsafe if untreated. On a larger scale, industries, services, and agricultural structures rely on water as a cheap and abundant resource. Yet they often operate without a clear consciousness of the impact of their individual operations on the environment and on other users. A largely unsuspected price (“the true price of water”) includes treatment and distribution and extends to the cost of leakages, evaporation, contaminations, inefficient usage and wasteful practices. 

6. Water brings life, yet it can kill
 
Since it sheltered the emergence of life 4 billion years ago, it has been irreplaceable for humans’ survival and basic needs (drinking, food, sanitation, and dignity). But unsafe waters impact public health through contamination and spread of infectious diseases. 

7. Water: a public or a private asset?
Even though water supply is a key political issue for every government and community, it is often treated and distributed by major corporate companies whose objective is profit. The decision on water management is always a local compromise between the various stakeholders and the society as a whole. 

8. Water is a global issue, yet management is local
Water is at the same time a shared asset and a common cause of risk. It is usable countless times by different actors in different locations, provided that those usages do not impact on its quality or availability for the next user. But unless mutual coordination and respect of others are upheld, sharing water may trigger liabilities and conflicts.

9. Water projects generate development but may induce concerns 
Water supports the dynamics of human societies. Major cultures and civilizations developed in direct proximity to water sources. Good water management greatly enhanced the growth of communities. New technologies are still being introduced to master water resources: desalination plants, water recycling, nanotechnologies. 

 
“There is no substitute for water”
Rattan Lal, Director of the School of Environment and Natural Resources, Ohio State University

10. Origins of Water Scarcity and Expected Developments 

Water scarcity originates from the deficiency in water availability to meet the different users’ needs and can take different forms: usage exceeding resources, limited access to resources due to the lack of infrastructure, to inadequate sanitation or to pollution. Water scarcity results from a complex interplay of multiple factors. The physical absence of water is the most obvious cause, but poor water management and anthropic causes are contributing to a greater and greater extent.

 11. Type of water resources 

Different types of renewable water resources need to be distinguished:
- Blue water is the part of rainfall going directly to rivers by runoff or infiltrating into the ground to feed the aquifers and it is a major renewable water resource. 
- Green water is the part of rainfall temporarily stored into the upper soil layer, and taken back to the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil and transpiration of vegetation and it is another major renewable water resource. 
- Ice, by melting and it is renewable if new snow compensates each year for the melted part. 
- Apart from these renewable water resources, Fossil water stored in aquifers is non-sustainable ‘blue-water’ groundwater stocks are increasingly tapped into and will eventually run out. 


12. New technologies and Innovations 

As the need for water treatment is growing, new technologies are being developed. Desalination is an emerging process increasingly used. It is more energy intensive than traditional water treatments and, because of its cost,
 is only adapted for dry regions. Large projects are developing in the Middle East, in the US, Australia, and Europe 
Other alternatives aim at reducing the environmental impact of water treatment.
Treating large quantities of reused water to make it drinkable again would require enormous amounts of energy: 
for that reason and for cultural ones – event treated, some people have trouble accepting the fact that they are drinking wastewater – it is still not acceptable at an industrial scale. Advanced technologies permit individual drinkable water reuse. Point-of-use water treatment systems, i.e. portable water purification devices, can cleanse drinking water at an affordable cost in individual homes or commercial establishments. Decentralized treatment systems offer an interesting alternative as they require less investment and simplify the access of households to wastewater treatments.

13. True cost of water 

The true cost of water is a key starting point. It looks beyond just the price of the cubic meter as it encompasses also monetization of water related risks having already materialized for cities and industries while looking as well as indirect costs and missed opportunities. 
Indeed assessing the true cost of water is not straightforward and includes several aspects: 
1. Direct costs: Water price, cost of treatment plants and of other infrastructures. In Europe the price of potable water to the public varies from 1€/m3 (Italy) to 6.4€/m3 (Denmark). The water resources available and the state subsidies vary from one country to another. 
2. Indirect costs: Such as cost of public relations, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), lawyers, fines. 
3. Risks impacts: Such as remediation costs and downtime in case of pollution, drought, flooding. 
4. Missed opportunities: Positive impact of good water management in terms of investors’ attractiveness and opportunities in creating new revenue streams by selling treated wastewater to third parties for reuse. It includes as well new financial opportunities to capture, such as negotiating better insurance premium when mitigating risks and enhancing resilience & robustness.

“Water stress is already exacting a price on people and economies”
Junaid Ahmad, Senior Director for Water, World Bank Group


14. The World need innovative approaches and solutions 

•Technological solutions 
•Smart investments 
•Integration with other functions 
•Instead of reïnventing the wheel, let’s learn from nature 

15. Blue Planet, Scarce Water 

We live on a watery planet, but less than 1% of all that freshwater is available for ecosystems and human use in
rivers, lakes, and aquifers. Yet, these life-giving freshwater systems face a host of threats from over-abstraction, 
fragmentation, pollution, climate change, and the ever-increasing demands of a growing population. 

16. Water for Drinking 

Healthy freshwater systems provide drinking water. In fact, while we need only drink 3-5 liters per day to 
remain healthy, the food we eat, clothes we wear, the energy we consume and products we use daily 
take tens of thousands of liters to produce.
A systemic and cross-sectoral ‘urban ecosystem’ approach is needed to design and implement
solutions to the multifaceted challenges. The main objective of this priority is to help design, implement and upscale
place-based and people-based transition pathways towards resilient, sustainable, low-carbon and resource efficient urban area.


17. Next step

We need to launch our eWATER solution to raise international awareness about the importance of water and identify strategies to raise the awareness of our clients and consumers. Advanced technologies permit individual drinkable water reuse. Point-of-use water treatment systems, i.e. portable water purification devices, can cleanse drinking water at an affordable cost in individual homes or commercial establishments. Decentralized treatment systems offer an interesting alternative as they require less investment and simplify the access of households to wastewater treatments.


18. eWATER solution - revolution

We at Zero Carbon a smart water tech startup, are dedicated to environmental preservation by developing and deploying societal and disruptive technologies. Our mission is very ambitious – we want to provide safe and clean drinking water to all world population every day, anytime and anywhere. Without any extra infrastructure at an affordable cost.

Picture this, a water ATM in the middle of the busy city, on a busy street that produces the purest, high-quality pure drinking water available today. Out of air. The water produced is not only pure and free of any contaminants but also beneficial to your health. Our consumers pay per use with coins, mobile payment or smart wearables linked to blockchain smart contract.
We can supply world population with most important substances on earth the drinking water. 




 “Without major technological innovations there is little hope of bringing the water equation into balance. There is no doubt that many technological changes can help improve services for millions and reduce the stress on water systems around the world.”
                                                                                                                   The World Water Council 



How it works
eWATER is a pay per- use drinking water refill ATM system. As the name implies, is a sort of a water vending machine except that in a water is produced out of the air. The water produced is not only pure and free of any contaminants but also available on demand 24/7 all year around. 
Our consumers pay per use of drinking water before refill bottle they have. 

They pay with coins, use mobile payment or smart wearables linked to blockchain smart contract. Payment goes into the machine in return for water. 

These machines are built, owned and operated by ZERO CARBON. The water ATM is providing safe and clean drinking water every day, anytime and anywhere. 

This concept will totally reduce the financial burden of the government cost of the water infrastructure. 

We will provide drinking water to people in the range of 10-20 cent euro (€0.10 – 0.20) per 1 liter on a pilot basis.

eWATER ATMs have the following advantages for consumers:
•	24 x 7 provision 
•	Water quality accountability and control
•	Pay-per-use methodology
•	Price transparency and flexible purchase
•	No Water Shortage
•	Eliminate overuse of PET bottles
 They also benefit project stakeholders as follows:
•	Off-grid functionality and environment-friendly
•	Low O&M requirement ensure water fee is affordable
•	Information layering (through cloud connectivity) for accountability (tracking each user transaction)
•	Service optimisation by monitoring key process parameters real-time online
•	Adaptable to various location types (streets, outdoor community spaces, school, hospital, etc.
•	Potential for targeted subsidies
•	Increases social impact

False,15 Major Current Environmental Problems,"1. Pollution: Pollution of air, water and soil require millions of years to recoup. Industry and motor vehicle exhaust are the number one pollutants. Heavy metals, nitrates and plastic are toxins responsible for pollution. While water pollution is caused by oil spill, acid rain, urban runoff; air pollution is caused by various gases and toxins released by industries and factories and combustion of fossil fuels; soil pollution is majorly caused by industrial waste that deprives soil from essential nutrients.
2. Global Warming: Climate changes like global warming is the result of human practices like emission of Greenhouse gases. Global warming leads to rising temperatures of the oceans and the earth’ surface causing melting of polar ice caps, rise in sea levels and also unnatural patterns of precipitation such as flash floods, excessive snow or desertification.
3. Overpopulation: The population of the planet is reaching unsustainable levels as it faces shortage of resources like water, fuel and food. Population explosion in less developed and developing countries is straining the already scarce resources. Intensive agriculture practiced to produce food damages the environment through use of chemical fertilizer, pesticides and insecticides. Overpopulation is one of the crucial current environmental problem.
4. Natural Resource Depletion: Natural resource depletion is another crucial current environmental problems. Fossil fuel consumption results in emission of Greenhouse gases, which is responsible for global warming and climate change. Globally, people are taking efforts to shift to renewable sources of energy like solar, wind, biogas and geothermal energy. The cost of installing the infrastructure and maintaining these sources has plummeted in the recent years.
5. Waste Disposal: The over consumption of resources and creation of plastics are creating a global crisis of waste disposal. Developed countries are notorious for producing an excessive amount of waste or garbage and dumping their waste in the oceans and, less developed countries. Nuclear waste disposal has tremendous health hazards associated with it. Plastic, fast food, packaging and cheap electronic wastes threaten the well being of humans. Waste disposal is one of urgent current environmental problem. 6. Climate Change: Climate change is yet another environmental problem that has surfaced in last couple of decades. It occurs due to rise in global warming which occurs due to increase in temperature of atmosphere by burning of fossil fuels and release of harmful gases by industries. Climate change has various harmful effects but not limited to melting of polar ice, change in seasons, occurrence of new diseases, frequent occurrence of floods and change in overall weather scenario.
7. Loss of Biodiversity: Human activity is leading to the extinction of species and habitats and and loss of bio-diversity. Eco systems, which took millions of years to perfect, are in danger when any species population is decimating. Balance of natural processes like pollination is crucial to the survival of the eco-system and human activity threatens the same. Another example is the destruction of coral reefs in the various oceans, which support the rich marine life.
8. Deforestation: Our forests are natural sinks of carbon dioxide and produce fresh oxygen as well as helps in regulating temperature and rainfall. At present forests cover 30% of the land but every year tree cover is lost amounting to the country of Panama due to growing population demand for more food, shelter and cloth. Deforestation simply means clearing of green cover and make that land available for residential, industrial or commercial purpose.
9. Ocean Acidification: It is a direct impact of excessive production of CO2. 25% of CO2 produced by humans. The ocean acidity has increased by the last 250 years but by 2100, it may shoot up by 150%. The main impact is on shellfish and plankton in the same way as human osteoporosis.
10. Ozone Layer Depletion: The ozone layer is an invisible layer of protection around the planet that protects us from the sun’s harmful rays. Depletion of the crucial Ozone layer of the atmosphere is attributed to pollution caused by Chlorine and Bromide found in Chloro-floro carbons (CFC’s). Once these toxic gases reach the upper atmosphere, they cause a hole in the ozone layer, the biggest of which is above the Antarctic. The CFC’s are banned in many industries and consumer products. Ozone layer is valuable because it prevents harmful UV radiation from reaching the earth. This is one of the most important current environmental problem.
11. Acid Rain: Acid rain occurs due to the presence of certain pollutants in the atmosphere. Acid rain can be caused due to combustion of fossil fuels or erupting volcanoes or rotting vegetation which release sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. Acid rain is a known  environmental problem that can have serious effect on human health, wildlife and aquatic species.
12. Water Pollution: Clean drinking water is becoming a rare commodity. Water is becoming an economic and political issue as the human population fights for this resource. One of the options suggested is using the process of desalinization. Industrial development is filling our rivers seas and oceans with toxic pollutants which are a major threat to human health.
13. Urban Sprawl: Urban sprawl refers to migration of population from high density urban areas to low density rural areas which results in spreading of city over more and more rural land. Urban sprawl results in land degradation, increased traffic, environmental issues and health issues. The ever growing demand of land displaces natural environment consisting of flora and fauna instead of being replaced.
14: Public Health Issues: The current environmental problems pose a lot of risk to health of humans, and animals. Dirty water is the biggest health risk of the world and poses threat to the quality of life and public health. Run-off to rivers carries along toxins, chemicals and disease carrying organisms. Pollutants cause respiratory disease like Asthma and cardiac-vascular problems. High temperatures encourage the spread of infectious diseases like Dengue.
15. Genetic Engineering: Genetic modification of food using biotechnology is called genetic engineering. Genetic modification of food results in increased toxins and diseases as genes from an allergic plant can transfer to target plant. Genetically modified crops can cause serious environmental problems as an engineered gene may prove toxic to wildlife. Another drawback is that increased use of toxins to make insect resistant plant can cause resultant organisms to become resistant to antibiotics.
The need for change in our daily lives and the movements of our government is growing. Because so many different factors come into play; voting, governmental issues, the desire to stick to routine, many people don’t consider that what they do will affect future generations. If humans continue moving forward in such a harmful way towards the future, then there will be no future to consider. Although it’s true that we cannot physically stop our ozone layer from thinning (and scientists are still having trouble figuring out what is causing it exactly,) there are still so many things we can do to try and put a dent in what we already know. By raising awareness in your local community and within your families about these issues, you can help contribute to a more environmentally conscious and friendly place for you to live.

I WOULD LIKE PERSONAL OPINIONS ON WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN SO FAR AND IDEAS ON WHAT TO ADD, I WOULD ALSO GREATLY LOVE TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT. Sorry if this is not the right place to post, this may include personal opinion.


**Plastic and its effects on your life**

[PICTURE]
  

The plastic industry has been blooming since the 1900s. It has only recently become a problem, not only for our life, but for the planet and the animals living on the planet. According to a research done by the Australian government, most single use plastic bags have an expected life time of only one trip from the stores resulting in the use of over 520 bags per person per year to meet shopping demands. Also, only about 5% of the bags get recycled, with over 75.5% ending in landfills. Once recycled, the bags do not get recycled, and 80.5% of them end up in landfills.  When looking at paper bags, commonly thought to be a safer and more eco-friendly option, we can see that about 60% gets recycled, and only 39.5% are sent to landfills.  While these numbers might be refreshing, paper bags are not a better option than plastic because of their high pollution capabilities and their cost. Then again, the recycled version of paper bags do not get recycled, and 99.5% of them end in landfills. What is shocking is the amount of reusable non-woven and woven “green bags” that end in landfills. At a 99.5% rate, the reusable eco-friendly bags seem to end up in landfills more than anything else. This is caused by the very little amount of ways to recycle them once their life expectancy ends. According to the research, you will only need an average of 4.55 bags per year, compared to the 520 of plastic bags, and these bags have a life expectancy of 2 years. This results in saving over 1000 bags per person in 2 years, about 114 times less bags needed.


**Plastic or paper?**

While paper bags seem to be a friendlier alternative to plastic bags, they are not. According to PROJECT GREENBAG, paper bags are made by heating wood chips under pressure at high temperatures in chemical solutions, causing massive pollution to the air and water as these chemicals are poured into waterways, working its way up the food chain all the way to us, humans. According to a Washington Post article, it takes more than four times energy to make a paper bag than it does a plastic bag. “Paper bags generate 70% more air pollution and 50 times more water pollutants than plastic bags.”  Also, paper bags have a high impact on forests. In the United States alone, in 1999, 14 million trees were used to make 10 billion paper bags.   It takes 98% less energy to recycle a pound of plastic than it takes to recycle a pound of paper. According to these statistics, even though the paper bag is more recycled, the plastic bag still seems to be the better option. 

**What about reusable bags?**

Reusable bags may not have any recyclable features yet, they seem to be the most eco-friendly and save option for the environment. This is because you only need 4.55 bags compared to the 520 plastic bags annually. It is not only more convenient as they are sturdier, but they can also hold more in the bag than plastic bags. If we set the average amount of items in a bag to be around 7, reusable bags could hold double that amount, depending on the size you end up buying and the size of the items you buy. Not only is it more convenient, but it is also more economical. Most stores charge an additional 10 cent per plastic bag that you use, resulting in over 52$ annually spent on something you only used once and then threw away. If you decide to buy woven reusable bags or non-woven (polypropylene) bags, the average cost is around 1$ per bag, costing you a total of 4-5$ annually. In summary, by being friendlier to the planet, you will also be saving 48$ annually, on average, simply by switching to a different type of bag. This option helps reduce the amount of plastic we use drastically as they are one of the main source of plastic. The downside of woven (cotton) bags is the amount of water needed to produce them is enormous. According to the WWF, it takes over 20000 litres of water to produce 1kg of cotton. With a woven bag weighing around 85g that means it would cost about 1700 litres of water for 1 bag. If we follow the statistics, that is about 7735L of water per year per person for the average 4.55 bags of woven reusable.  

**Are bags the only issues?**

If you want the short answer, no. Most plastic waste comes from products such as packaging, bottled water and lids. By simply eliminating these products or replacing them, we can eliminate most plastic waste in the country, certainly not reaching 0, but low enough that it is sustainable. You also have Styrofoam, a very difficult to recycle product as it is often contaminated by drinks and food, making it hard to clean, and because it costs more in energy to recycle it than to make it, causing the option to be ineffective cost wise. Styrofoam is also non-biodegradable and cannot be burned as it releases toxins and requires high energy. So what do we do with this one time use item? We throw it out into landfills, where some of it, just like any other waste, ends up in the ocean. 

**Why is plastic bad, and what can we do about it?**

The main problem with single use polymer is they invade marine life and create many problems for their life and our lives. Whether we choose to ignore it or not, the plastic crisis also has a major impact on humans. Small fish are digesting fragments of plastic, which makes its way up the food chain, eventually reaching us. These small pieces are found everywhere in the oceans and have become inevitable for animals to ingest. 
  
  [PICTURE]
  [PICTURE]

According to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the main debris found in the oceans sum up to Styrofoam, plastic (cups, bottles, straws) and glass, with plastic being nearly half of the debris in the ocean.   One of the prime examples of the impact of plastic on marine life is on lugworms. According to Stephanie Wright, a postgraduate researched in Bioscience, ocean sediments highly contaminated with plastics cause the lugworms to be less efficient and eat less. Also, according to Plymouth University, if the lugworm ingest the plastic, it can reduce their health as it contains harmful chemicals.  Predators of the lugworm include a big number of fish, crabs and birds. If the health of the lugworm is deteriorated, then so will the animal that ingests it. You can apply that same concept to humans, if we end up eating raw meat, something that we usually cannot digest, it will affect our body and make us sick. Same goes for animals, if they eat something that they cannot digest, it will affect them in different ways. Now imagine on a planetary scale, involving millions of species all around the globe.
 
**Why is this a global epidemic?**  
  [PICTURE]

The spin on the earth and the wind cause ocean currents to go in a certain way, called gyres. These gyres are circular and cause these so called “plastic islands”. With about 8 millions of tons of plastic leaking into the ocean yearly, with plastic bottles accounting for a very high percentage of that, about 2.5 million bottles per  hour for  the consumption of Americans, it is estimated that by 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean. The accumulation of all the trash in the gyres travels around the world by switching gyres. The toothbrush you threw out 3 months ago could very possibly be in Sri Lanka by now.  

**What can we do about it?**

(Personal solution) Other than switching to reusable bags, many different options are available to anyone immediately such as switching you’re one time products to eco-friendly reusable products. For example, toothbrushes could be replaced with bamboo brushes. Not only are they environmentally safe, but they are also a good economic choice as they cost nearly the same (A 4 piece pack online costs around 15$ CDN where as a 4 pack of normal plastic toothbrushes cost about 12$ CDN) One of the main reasons as to why people don’t act now is they decide to ignore the problem. It is way easier to live in a world where you ignore the negatives and create your own paradise version of it than to look at the horrible things going on and decide to face them. Since most plastics in the ocean are either in the bottom of the ocean or floating slightly under the surface, we cannot see them unless we use nets, causing people to believe that the crisis is not that important yet. People will start acting once the only thing you can see on the horizon is bottles and bottles, which by then will be too late as it means the ocean floor is full and so is everything else, meaning all life in the oceans is gone. 

(Government solution) Another possibility, one that would be way more beneficial as it wouldn’t be optional would be an Environmental Plastics tax. In summary, this tax would be an attempt by everyone to save the world. Another possibility would be banning the importation of any product that uses over 15% of its product’s weight in non-reusable one time packages. Many products come prepackaged with layers and layers of useless plastic simply to make it look elegant to the consumer. This packaging, for example mints in metal boxes that are also wrapped in paper, is useless and simply promotes pollution. Not only would packaging become cheaper as it would either have to be in smaller quantities but it would also have to be made of biodegradable or reusable packaging, forcing the company to take the packaging back and reutilize it. 

(Government solution) A third solution would be completely banning all material that cannot be recycled or reused, such as Styrofoam. The product can be replaced with a much simpler and more eco-friendly substance, such as bamboo bowls and cups, an easy to grow and very accessible plant, or edible cups made from plants or rice. This may not be the best solution, as after being recycled once, most things will usually end up in landfills, but it is a start. This may also not be the best solution economically speaking as Styrofoam is extremely cheap and any substance that replaces it would mean a small extra price to pay for everyone. 

**The EPT**

If the government would implement a tiny tax of 0.1% on all plastics, the possible changes would be radical. If all business’ over 1 million dollars in revenue annually would have to pay a 0.1% tax, along with a 0.1% tax on all products in stores that utilize plastics or any other form of non-degradable substance, Canada would be able to gather well over billions of dollars to use for environmental changes. The taxes amassed could only be used for environmental studies and solutions, promoting Canada as an eco-friendly country looking to better help the world.

It may only be 0.1%, but it’s a start, towards a cleaner and safer planet for us and all the animals in the ecosystem. It is better to start now than to start later, as we, the future generations, will be the ones to face the problems. If we do not start now, our kids might feel a small part of the problem, but our grand kids will have to deal with it for their whole life. The planet is our home, and if we do not take care of it, we won’t have a place to live anymore, whether it’s for us, our future, or the animals, join the cause, save the planet. This problem is a planetary scale problem and everyone has to do their part, is Canada willing to do theirs?

False,Vegetarianism and the Global Environment,"In most cases when someone is trying to argue or convince someone to understand their point of view when it comes to eating meat, they take the stance that it is cruel to the animals that are being killed and in a lot of cases that is true in terms of their production, but that argument didn’t work for me. I don't know if its because I'm heartless or desensitized to the point of not caring about the animals well being, but I was never swayed by that point of view. I know that the mistreatment of animals who are produced in large quantities suffer unneeded amounts, but that wasn’t a fact that moved me to make a change. It wasn't until I learned about how intensive animal farming or industrial livestock production affected the Earth in regards to global climate change that I reflected on my habits and how they effect the world around me. I think the idea that myself, someone I knew, my future children, or in general the planet that my species calls home could be put in jeopardy made me think. In this post I am going to discuss the facts that drove me to become a vegetarian and that I would hope would convince someone else to become one as well, or at least reduce the amount of meat they consume. I will use as many trusted sources as I can to provide information that I find to be very important for people to know and to reflect on. In a time where the validity of information is consistently being scrutinized, it is important that the information we spread is reliable.
	
Along with this idea of convincing people to become a vegetarian or at least eat less meat, which is a hard goal in itself, is to convince people that climate change exists and that it is propagated through human actions. For the sake of this post, I am not going to try to convince anyone that climate change is real or not because that would be a large conversation in itself. I am going to assume that anyone who reads any further has a similar mindset as myself when I first discovered this information about global climate change or maybe someone who has an open enough mind to read these this statistics and look into the problem themselves. The first thing that got to me when learning about the affects of meat consumption on the environment was my lack of understanding exactly how everything comes together to form what we know as climate change. I knew that CO2 was a major contributor that everyone focuses on and that methane, nitrous oxide and other gases played a part as well, but I did not know the extent in which agriculture and meat production play into every part that increase global climate change.
	
More often than not when people talk about climate change and its inputs, they are usually measuring the amount of CO2 which gives a somewhat distorted picture of what the true “foot print” is for any given producer of a green house gas. The other gas that needs to be given more attention is methane gas. Methane gas is not always heard about, more than likely because it accounts for a smaller portion of the total emissions and stays in the atmosphere for far less time, but it actually has a warming effect that is higher than that of CO2. While CO2 accounts for around 82 percent of human emissions and remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, methane accounts for what would seem to be a measly 11 percent. But methane has a global warming potential that is 28 to 36 times stronger than that of CO2, but only stays in the atmosphere for around a decade. These numbers show that methane is just as much of a contributor as CO2, but the real problem is the source that creates all of the methane.
	
Over the last 150 years methane levels have doubled as a result of human activities such as fossil fuel industry drilling for methane gas, as well as intensive agricultural farming practices and growing livestock. While the fossil fuel industry is still the leading producer of methane emissions at 33 percent, livestock and farming make up 27 percent and are aimed to increase in the future. While the amount of CO2 omitted and the need for methane gas for power could potentially decrease over time as a result of better technologies or the eventual peak oil crisis, methane from agriculture and livestock is different. The growth of the livestock industry will coincide with the growth of the human population that is estimated to be around 35 percent between 2006 and 2050. The more the population grows exponentially, exponentially more meat will need to be grown to feed those people, and the more meat needed to feed the population, more land will be repurposed to grow the feed required. This will decrease the amount of carbon sinks available to trap CO2 and keep it from being released into the atmosphere and further add to the problem.
	
Not only does eating a highly meat intense diet contribute to global climate change, but it also comes with a set of global environmental challenges that only become worse if the problem is not confronted. With the rate of population growth that we are currently following there could be upwards of 9 billion people on the planet by the year 2050. This would require an increase in agricultural space for production up to two times than we are currently producing, which would lead to increased loss of ecosystems around the world, including the rainforests that are home to some of the worlds most diverse wild life, as well as one of the largest carbon sinks. The increase in agricultural production would also require more water to the degree that it would be unsustainable and in some cases impractical with the agricultural sector already consuming a staggering 70 percent of the fresh water that is available on the planet. This problem would become increasingly worse since 85 percent of the worlds population lives on the driest half of the planet and three quarters of a billion people don't have access to clean water. The people who live in the drier areas would have no way to grow the amounts of agriculture needed to sustain their local populations and their need for protein rich meats, leading them to rely on other countries who would also be struggling pushing their production to the limits. The water use would increase the amount of chemical runoff from agricultural fields which would in turn contribute to low oxygen rich water, further reducing ocean biodiversity and affecting other kinds of business such as fishing that are important for feeding the world as well as some poorer communities that rely on fish as their main source of food. In terms of water, a shift from a meat heavy diet to a more plant based diet would reduce the amount of water needed to produce food, potentially helping eliminated or diminish the current world food and water crisis.
	
Per person the USDA advises that a healthy diet of meat should consist of about 125 pounds of beef per year. Of the 196 countries on Earth, there are 60 countries that eat more than the recommended amount. The amount of calories that are consumed by people directly through agriculture is only 55 percent while 36 percent is fed to livestock that is then fed to humans at a later time. If those countries that consume more than the recommended amount reduced their meat consumption, to the even the average amount by the year 2050, there is a chance that it could make an impact on the processes that we have to feed our local and global communities. It is obvious when confronted with the numbers and statistics that eating meat at the rate in which we do is unsustainable and a change must be made. Meat does not have to be completely cut out immediately, if at all, but there needs to be a dietary shift away from the consumption of highly inefficient meats. We could feed the world if the crops that we grew in our fields were intended to be eaten by people instead of an insane number of people, who are increasing in numbers exponentially. 
	
I am constantly learning new things in life and am always open to new things and becoming a vegetarian is something that I never thought I would adopt as a way of life. I truly love meat and I miss it all the time, but the world is bigger than my selfish desires. The world is constantly growing and so should our perceptions of it. There are so many things today that need to be changed and we are the ones who can make a difference, and this is a small step towards something great. I hope that the data I shared can change a few minds or open up some to a different way of living.

False,"[DISCUSSION/QUESTION] Seeing as we're going into an administration that will likely set back environmental progress, how can we convince more people why they should conserve resources if agriculture/manufacturing/etc uses far more?","I often have the discussion of conservation for many different resources and, while I'm entirely convinced to try and minimize my impact, many people bring up the point that individual (or oftentimes even community) efforts don't amount to all that much as compared to industry and agriculture which use orders of magnitude more.

My gut responses are as follows:

1. Poor behavior on the part of others doesn't justify your own poor behavior. Intentionally stepping on a ladybug on a nature trail is poor behavior just as stepping on a thousand bugs is poor behavior.

2. Even if an individual or community doesn't conserve all that much in the grand scheme of things, every drop does count. Say if a community eliminates 40% of its typical water use one year and continued to use that reduced amount the next year, it could make it through two thirds of the year on the typical amount of water required. This seems inherently positive to me, especially if the water reduction (or resource reduction) can be reduced in ways that don't detract (or majorly detract) from the quality of life of the members of the community. 

3. If conservation is holistic as opposed to individually resource focused, one can have a larger effect especially when acting as a community. If everyone in a town chooses to take up diets that require less energy to produce, opts to thrift more, buy what they need secondhand, grow their own food, and walk more, there will be an undeniable cascade effect on the very industries that use the most resources. These industries exist to sell and serve to us after all so if we reduce our demand they will reduce their supply.

4. Why not conserve if its typically more economical? It feels good and is a tangible way to see how much you reduce your resource consumption when you cut your power bill and water bill in half or lower your grocery expenses or find an extra $150 a month in saved gas money. 

Those reasons said, I'd like to hear what you all think.

False,Water Conservation,"I will start by saying that this is only a summary and required for class credit, please go out and educate yourself via credible sources. 

Water conservation is the act of preservation, control and development of water resources, both surface and groundwater, as well as prevention of pollution. Several factors contribute to the need for water conservation – global warming, over-consumption by corporations and civilians, chemical pollution, littering, population growth and inadequate sanitation methods. There are things being done to combat this growing epidemic such as the enactment of stricter regulations in regards to the usage of water and prevention of the pollution. The Paris Treaty signed in April of this year is one major step in the right direction as long as the countries keep their contractual promises. Oil companies and clothing manufacturers are some of the worst offenders of water pollution as far as corporations go however regular civilians are the most guilty by littering and having lack of appreciation and environmental education even in first world countries. Several companies have stepped up to combat this problem by changing policies to more green and eco-conscious work practices such as using less water, appliances that use less energy, using less chemicals and not illegally dumping them into waterways or otherwise. Consumers are also becoming more mindful of their purchases by choosing organic over non-organic, eating less meat, using less water, utilizing solar panels and other energy saving option, or not supporting companies that partake in chemical dumping etc. Other methods to contain and control current pollution include waterwheels that collect trash, sanitation stations, and educational programs the spread awareness. Less than ten years from now two thirds of the world will be struggling to support the water demand so action needs to be taken now. People are dying worldwide from water-borne diseases that derive from polluted waterways and even further their food sources that are tainted by the polluted water. Animals and humans depend on things to change for their survival, no one is exempt.

False,Emergency Alert - No Soil & Water Before 100% Renewable Energy,"Many say we can have 100% renewable energy by 2050.
 This is factually incorrect.

We can have 100% renewable electricity production by 2050.

But, electricity production only amounts to 18% of total world energy demand.

82% of total world energy demand is NOT electricity production.

The other 82% of the world’s energy is used to extract minerals to construct roads, cement, bricks, glass, steel so we can eat and relax. Solar panels and wind turbines will not be making cement or steel anytime soon. Why? Do you really want to know? Here you go.

Total World Energy Demand = TWED
-----------------------------------------

18% of TWED is electrical grid generation.

82% of TWED is not electrical grid generation.

In 20 years, solar-wind energy is up from 1% to 3% of TWED.

Solar-wind power are projected to provide only 6% of TWED by 2030.

When you hear projections about solar-wind generating 50% of electrical power by 2050, that’s really only 9% of TWED.
100% of electrical production is 18% of TWED.

But, it takes 10X as much solar-wind energy to close 1 fossil fuel power plant simply because they don’t produce energy all the time.

That means it will take 10 X 18% of TWED to close all fossil power plants.

Research says it will take 4 X 82% of TWED for a 100% wind-solar energy transition.

10 X 18% + 4 X 82% = 100% intermittent TWED.

To get the same total power we use now, we would need several times more intermittent energy. Renewable energy is unsustainable without massive energy demand destruction.

These figures do not include massive electrical storage and grid infrastructure. Such infrastructure is hundreds of millions of tons of materials taking decades, demanding more energy and additional trillions of dollars.

Solar-wind systems last 30 years meaning we will always have to replace them all over the world again 50% sooner than fossil sources.

Solar and wind power are an energy trap. The real reason solar panels are so cheap is because China manufactures and ships them to 75% of the world’s solar market. China ignores all safety and environmental laws and has a very low currency.

It takes 1 ton of coal to make 6-12 solar panels.

China will build 6 nuclear plants per year until 2030 and they want about 400 by 2050 because they know they can’t build solar panels without nuclear power.

Business As Usual = BAU
----------------------------

In 15 years 40% of humanity will be short of water with BAU.

In 15 years 20% of humanity will be severely short of water.

Right now, 1 billion people walk a mile every day for water.

In 60 years humanity will not have enough soil to grow food says Scientific American. Humanity’s soil is eroding away and being degraded at 24 million acres per year. This number will increase with severe droughts, storms and low-land floods.

50% of Asia’s low-land rice paddies are threatened.

50% of humanity depends on rice to survive.

A 100% TWED transition will take 2 generations to get done — minimum. It is a vastly more difficult and complex goal than you are told.

We are losing earth’s soil and fresh water faster than we can effect 100% renewable TWED.

In 25 years civilization will end says Lloyds of London and the British Foreign Office.

In my opinion, in 30 years we won’t have enough fossil fuel for a 100% renewable TWED transition.

This is the most important fact I’ve learned:

Renewable energy is unsustainable without massive energy demand destruction.

Humanity will destroy its soil and water faster than we can switch to renewable energy with BAU. Without massive political-economic change, civilization will collapse with 100% certainty. But, don’t worry, I like to fix things.

Animal Agriculture = AA
--------------------------

Humans + Livestock = 97% of the weight of all land vertebrate biomass

Humans + Livestock = 80% of the cause of all land-air extinctions

Humans + Livestock = 50% of the use of all land surface area

Humans + Livestock = 40% consumption of all land plant growth *
 
* Net Primary Production.

50% of the soy grown in South America is shipped over to China to feed their pigs. Rainforests are cleared to grow animal feed and the required fresh water is, in reality, diverted to China. The Himalayan mountains are heating 2X faster than the planet and many fear that China will run out of water in 15 years by 2030.

50% of China’s rivers have vanished since 1980.

60% of China’s groundwater is too poisoned to touch.

50% of China’s cropland is too poisoned to safely grow food.

Animal agriculture will destroy our soil and water long before we can effect 100% intermittent energy transition with BAU.

7 billion people will not stop eating meat and wasting food without major incentive. Meaning a steadily rising carbon tax on meat. Just saying that can get you killed in some places.

Without using James Hansen’s 100% private tax dividends to carbon tax meat consumption out of the market earth will die. 100% private tax dividends means 100% for you, 0% for government.

100% for you, 
    0% for gov.

We have to act now, not 5 years from now, or forever be not remembered as the least greatest generation because there’ll be no one left to remember us.

Michasel Mann says we will lock-in a 2 degree temperature rise in 3 years for 2036 with BAU. Ocean fish will be gone in less than 25 years.

We cannot let governments get control of carbon markets like how Sanders, Klein and McKibben want government to get 60% of your carbon tax money. This is in direct opposition to Hansen’s tax dividend plan and immoral. I strongly believe your carbon dividends should be in a new open-source world e-currency directly deposited to your phone to be phased in over 10 years.

James Hansen repeated at COP21 that his 100% private carbon tax dividends would unite Democrats and Republicans because government would be excluded. Socialists like Sanders, Klein and McKibben want government to control that money. They are divisive and confrontational and Republicans will never accept their revolutionary dreams. We don’t have time for this endless fighting. We only have time to unite and nothing unites like money. Environmentalism in the 21st century is about a revolving door of money and power for socialists, and not the environment.

82% of total world energy use is not electrical generation.

After 20 years, solar-wind energy production is up from 1% to 3% of total world energy use.

Solar-wind power are projected to provide 6% of total energy use by 2030.

It takes 10X as much solar-wind energy to close 1 fossil fuel power plant simply because they are intermittent.

It will take 10 X 18% of total world energy use to close all fossil power plants.

And, it will take 4 X 82% of total world energy use for a 100% wind-solar energy transition.

These figures do not include massive electrical storage and grid infrastructure.

Such infrastructure is hundreds of millions of tons of materials taking decades and additional trillions of dollars.

Solar-wind systems last 30 years meaning we will always have to do it all over the world again 50% sooner than fossil sources.

False,Conventional vs Organic Farming,"I am a conventional farmer in Western Canada (growing wheat, canola, malt barley and oats), and am also a professional engineer (mechanical).  

A couple of months ago, I stumbled across one of my old engineering professor's Twitter accounts and saw him bashing conventional agriculture and promoting organic.  I put together some information for him to challenge his views and make him realize that the issues are not as ""cut and dried"" as he was making them out to be.  I have since shared it with a few other people, and have been encouraged to publish it online.

So, here it goes...


**A bit of background on me....**

I grew up on a family farm in Western Canada.  I studied Mechanical Engineering and graduated with my Bachelor's in 2008.  I had the top marks in my class, and received the Gold Medal in Mechanical Engineering.  I continued at the same university for two more years and completed a thesis-based Master's degree. 

Upon graduating, I worked for a small bio-energy firm  for three years and earned my P.Eng.  After finishing my P.Eng, I made the decision to leave my full time job so I could be more involved with the farm (while I enjoy engineering, the farm has always been my passion).  I continue to practice as an engineer during off-peak times on the farm with a small company that specializes in doing energy audits.

Together with my brother (who has a BSc in Agriculture (Crop Sciences)), my dad, and one full-time employee, we farm approximately 5,250 acres of farmland (roughly 8.2 square miles, or 21.2 square kilometers).  We generally grow wheat, canola, oats and malt barley, all for human consumption (not animal feed).  In a typical year, our farm produces around 8,000 Metric Tonnes of grain (imagine how many people that feeds!).

We employ a wide variety of advanced farming techniques, including zero-tillage farming, GPS auto-steer and sectional control (to avoid over-application of fertilizer and pesticides), GPS yield mapping, variable rate fertilizer applications (to target fertilizer to the areas of the field with high yield potential), and are even experimenting with the use of UAV drones for data collection.

I'm not sure what your views/experience with agriculture are, but I thought I would share some of my views on various topics that seem to come up from individuals that have concerns with modern agriculture.

**Sustainability**

One point that I often see raised is sustainability - many people feel that organic farming is more sustainable than conventional farming.  A couple points I would like to raise on this:

- Does yield factor into your definition of sustainability?  Yields in conventional agriculture are significantly higher than yields in organic farming. A meta-analysis of organic and conventional farming found that yields from organic agriculture are often as much as 34% lower than from conventional agriculture. (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature11069.html?message-global=remove)

When less food is produced from each acre of land, then more land must be brought into production.  The bio-fuels industry received a lot of criticism for causing deforestation of the Brazilian rainforests because so much corn was being used to make ethanol.  Organic farming (which produces less per acre, thus requiring more land) is just as responsible for this.

- Another factor that is often overlooked is nutrients.  One of the biggest environmental impacts of conventional agriculture is the large amounts of energy required to produce synthetic fertilizers.  However, organic farmers are reliant on conventional farmers in this area...

Determining how much fertilizer is required for a crop is a fairly simple mass balance.  The grain we harvest each year contains nutrients.  Thus, each year we must apply enough fertilizer to offset the nutrients we are removing in the grain.  We monitor this over time by having soil from each of our fields tested by a lab every year to ensure that nutrient levels are being maintained.

Organic farmers face this same challenge.  However, organic farming does not allow for the use of synthetic fertilizer.  While crop rotations can be used to satisfy some of their nutrient requirements (crops like peas and beans have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in their roots and take nitrogen from the air and make it available to the plant - and note, conventional farmers utilize this too!), they often apply manure as fertilizer.  That manure is often from animals that have been eating conventional grain (so the nutrients in the manure are from synthetic fertilizer).  A study done in [France](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/4/044045/article) found that 23% of the Nitrogen, 73% of the Phosphorous, and 53% of the Potassium nutrients (the 3 main macro-nutrients) used in organic farming were from synthetic fertilizer.  So in reality, the only difference is that the nutrients that organic farmers use have gone through the digestive tract of a cow ;)

- The last sustainability topic that I want to bring up is tillage.  Over the past 20 years, nearly every acre of grain farmland in Western Canada has been converted to zero-tillage farming.  Each spring, the new crop is seeded directly into the stubble from the previous year's crop with the smallest amount of soil disturbance possible.  This practice has drastically reduced soil erosion, it helps conserve moisture, and it sequesters carbon in the soil (in fact, farmers who adopt this practice in Alberta generate Carbon Offset credits).

I grew up in the 80's, when tillage was still the norm.  To seed our crops, we used to have to make anywhere from 3 to 8 passes over our fields.  The result was soil that was completely pulverized, bone dry, and susceptible to wind erosion.

Nearly all the fence lines in Western Canada have dirt ""drifts"" along them, from soil erosion.  My parents have pictures of me and my sister playing outside when we were young on black snow, since wind had blown soil from nearby fields into our yard.  After a windy day, rural counties used to have to send crews out to dig the soil of of the ditches along the county roads and dump it back on the farmer's fields.

Why do I bring this up?  Organic farmers are utilizing tillage to control weeds.  Still sound more sustainable than conventional farming?

**Pesticides**

Another point that I often see raised is pesticides - here are some thoughts on that...

- First of all, organic farmers use them too.  While they are not allowed to use synthetic pesticides, they are allowed to use naturally occurring ones.  However, as I'm sure you realize, not everything found in nature is ""safe"" or ""less toxic"" than synthetically made things.  Many of the ""natural"" pesticides used in organic farming are more toxic than the synthetic ones used in conventional farming.

[Here](https://twitter.com/DavidKucher/status/602649450310275073/photo/1) is a list of pesticides allowed in organic farming. 

- Newer, safer pesticides are constantly being developed.  Of the three classes of pesticides (herbicides, which control weeds; fungicides, which control plant diseases; and insecticides, which control insects), insecticides are the most dangerous.  We are fortunate in Western Canada that our cold climate does a good job of controlling insects, so we very rarely have to use them.  However, sometimes insect infestations happen and they do need to be used.

One of the major downsides of using an insecticide is that they are non-selective, meaning that they kill ALL insects in the fields (including beneficial insects that feed on the pest insects, and pollinators like bees).  As a result, farmers take the decision to use an insecticide very seriously!

Dupont has recently developed a new insecticide called [Coragen](http://www.dupont.ca/content/dam/assets/industries/agriculture/assets/cp_PSD-67_Coragen_Tech_Bulletin_Canola_E.pdf) which helps address this issue.  Rather than killing insects on contact by attacking their nervous system, the insecticide coats the plants.  When insects eat the plant, the chemical paralyzes their jaws, causing them to starve.  The insecticide has no impact on bees and other beneficial insects.

Rather than being able to embrace new products like this, organic farmers will have to continue using the highly toxic ""natural"" insecticides that they are permitted to use (such as pyrethrin - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrethrin)

- Using the least amount of pesticides possible is the goal of all farmers - they are very expensive! (and we are the ones exposed to them in their most concentrated form - using less of them reduces our exposure to them).

All farmers (conventional and organic) practice Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Throughout the year, a wide variety of measures are taken to control pests, with pesticides being only one of them.

Some examples of IPM would include: establishing a healthy plant stand (through proper seeding rates) to enable the plants to out-compete pests, selecting varieties that are resistant to pests (and rotating varieties, to ensure that resistance does not break down), utilizing crop rotations (certain pests target certain crops), and eliminating areas where insects/weeds live/breed (ex: mowing weeds in ditches/abandoned yardsites to prevent them from going to seed). When a pesticide is used, the field is first scouted to verify that it is in fact necessary, the pesticide is applied at the correct rate and at the correct time, and the pesticides used are rotated from year to year to avoid developing resistance).

**GMO's**

Another topic that draws a lot of attention is genetically modified crops (such as in the March Against Monsanto this past weekend).  A few points on them...

- The scientific consensus is that GMO's are safe.  The Pew Research Center polled the membership of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and found that 88% of scientists feel it is safe to eat genetically modified food (which is greater than the 87% consensus that humans are causing climate change).  In contrast, only 37% of the general public feels that GMO's are safe.  This is the largest gap in opinion between scientists and the general public.

- There is more to GMO's than Monsanto.  For example, GMO's saved the Hawaiian papaya industry by developing a variety that was resistant to a disease that nearly wiped out that industry; GMO's are being used to develop orange trees that are resistant to a disease that is threatening the Florida orange industry; GMO's have been used to develop bio-fortified crops, such as Golden Rice; etc.

- GMO's are helping farmers to reduce the use of pesticides.  Bt crops have cut down on the amount of insecticides by making the crops naturally resistant to insect attacks.  Round-up Ready crops (resistant to the herbicide glyphosate) have increased the use of glyphosate; however, glyphosate is less toxic than the herbicides that it has replaced (ie: the herbicides used to control weeds in non-GMO crops).

On our own farm, we grow GMO canola.  The other crops we grow (wheat, oats, and malt barley) are all non-GMO (no GMO varieties are registered for use).  In the past 20 years, our canola yields have doubled (from approximately 25 bushels/acre to 50 bushels per acre), while the amount of herbicides (and their toxicity) we use have decreased.

Yields of our other (non-GMO) crops have increased too, but at a much, much slower rate (in the same period of time, wheat yields would have gone from around 50 bushels/acre to 60 bushels/acre, a 20% increase).

**Monsanto**

A lot of the public's disdain for modern agriculture is directed at Monsanto.  Here are some points on that...

- Growing GMO crops requires farmers to enter into a contract with the company that developed the seed (Monsanto, Bayer, etc - Monsanto is not the only company that makes GMO's).  Farmers are free to choose whether or not to do this (if they don't want to, they can grow non-GMO crops).  However, many farmers do choose to grow them, because the increased yields and other benefits they offer outweigh the additional costs.

One of the terms of the contract is that the farmers must purchase new seed every year.  Farmers often do this regardless of whether they are growing GMO or non-patented non-GMO crops.  Crops bred through hybridization (corn, canola, etc) only exhibit the increased plant vigor they offer for one generation, so new seed must be used each year.  For crops that don't use hybrid breeding (wheat, oats, barley, etc), breeders are constantly releasing new varieties with improved traits (higher yields, disease resistance, etc), so farmers often purchase new seed regularly to take advantage of this.

- Monsanto has never sued farmers for accidental contamination of their crops. (http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/gm-seed-accidentally-in-farmers-fields.aspx).  

They do sue farmers who breach their contract with Monsanto and save seed and replant it without paying royalties - rightly so though! Monsanto spends roughly $1 billion per year on research and development - they need to make a return on that investment.  In addition to that, if they were to allow some farmers to break the rules and not pay royalties, then it puts the farmers who do play by the rules at a disadvantage (since they have higher costs than their neighbors who are not paying the royalty).

- Monsanto is primarily a seed business, not a pesticide manufacturer.  Round-Up (glyphosate) is the only pesticide they manufacture, and it has been off-patent for a number of years.  The majority of the glyphosate used is ""generic"" (ie: made by other companies).

- Organic food is big business too.  Whole Foods (an organic supermarket chain) has yearly sales that are approximately equal to Monsanto's.

**General Comments**

A few random comments...

- ""Corporate"" farms are not big, ""evil"" companies.  My family's farm is a ""corporate"" farm (ie: it is ""incorporated"").  Many family farms do this for tax purposes.  Our farming business pays each of use a wage to live on, and the rest of the farm's profits stay in the farm and are re-invested (in land, machinery, etc).

- Like all things in life, agriculture involves ""balancing"" many competing objectives/goals. Farming requires balancing environmental conservation with the need to feed a growing population (with less labor, since trends are towards increased urbanization) at a reasonable cost (even in ""first world"" countries like Canada there are people who cannot afford to eat proper meals!).

- To me, it is important for farmers to produce food  in the most efficient way possible.  If someone is a small market gardener on the outskirts a city, and they have enough labor to grow everything ""organically"" and feel that those practices make them most efficient, then great! They should absolutely do that! However, suggesting that ALL farming should be organic, when nothing suggests that this is even possible, is a terrible attitude (and one that is only possible for very privileged, first-world urbanites).

- While some ""organic"" farming practices do have merit (as I discussed, there are lots that conventional farmers use too!), organic farming as a whole is too much about conforming to an arbitrary set of ""rules"", rather than doing what is best/most efficient.  Technology is going to continue to develop, and organic farmers are not going to be able to embrace many new things coming down the pipeline (GMO crops bred to be more nutrient/water efficient, insecticides like the one I mentioned that only target pest insects, etc).

- Technology has improved every aspect of our lives - why wouldn't we apply it to farming?  I often wonder if when the ""pro-organic"" people go to the doctor's office if they ask to be treated using technology from 70 years ago?  If not, then why do they do that when they buy food???

- Lastly, I'm going to share a TED talk on agriculture with you.  It was done by an agrologist from Alberta.  I feel it does an excellent job articulating the challenges affecting modern agriculture.  Of all the links I have shared in this email, this is the one I would most encourage you to check out :)

False,"Unsustainability, Consumption, and What It Means to Be Human","Achieving sustainability is one of the greatest challenges that humanity has ever faced and will become a main focus during the twenty-first century. In the past hundred years humanity has made innumerable accomplishments that have made the world a better place, but at the same time we have also seen a degradation of the natural systems that support life due to an increase in irresponsible human activities. By driving our cars and powering our cities we pollute our air, through industrial agriculture we degrade the soil that grows our food, through excessive consumption we cut down the forests that clean our water and we overfish our seas, and the list goes on. Earnest Callenbach, author of Ecology: A Pocket Guide, defines a sustainable society as “one that satisfies its needs without diminishing the prospects of future generations.” In today’s modern society we have an array of cultural habits we use to solve problems, but many of these habits unfortunately do not generate the desired outcomes we seek, and can sometimes lead to self-destructiveness. If we hope to continue to thrive into the future it is essential that we learn to fulfill our human aspirations in ways that will lead to genuine satisfaction, and still provide future generations the ability to meet their basic needs and aspirations.

In today’s modern postindustrial society we have seen great strides in providing the masses with the ability to meet their needs and desires through an increase in accessibility to resources. After World War II, many corporations were fearing that the demand for production would decrease and they would reach overproduction (BBC). The solution that has become the norm in our economic culture was well articulated by the retail analyst, Victor Lebow, “Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction and our ego satisfaction in consumption. We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.” This has disaffected the people in modern society by emphasizing the importance of having, and leads us to seek our sense of meaning and fulfillment through consumption.

Through this mode of thinking we have prevented ourselves from flourishing in nearly every sense of the word, and through our hunger to acquire more we have forgotten that there is more to life than having things. Humanist philosopher and social psychologist, Erich Fromm, wrote that, “Human beings had two basic orientations: HAVING and BEING. HAVING: seeks to acquire, possess things even people. BEING: focuses on the experience; exchanging, engaging, sharing with other people.” Today we live in a society where the dominant cultural paradigm (consumerism) is dominated by the having orientation, and Fromm believed that people who lived with such an orientation ultimately feel a sense of emptiness and dissatisfaction.

In Dr. John Ehrenfeld’s book, Sustainability by Design: A Subversive Strategy for Transforming Our Consumer Culture, he discusses how immersion in this cultural paradigm has disaffected humans in three critical domains. He writes, “Flourishing can occur only if we pay close attention to the three critical domains that the forces of modernity have dimmed: Our sense of ourselves as human beings: the human domain. Our sense of our place in the [natural] world: the natural domain. Our sense of doing the right thing: the ethical domain,” (Ehrenfeld 58). Wasteful and unsatisfying consumption, breakdowns in personal and familial relationships, litigiousness, degradation of the environment, and what most people understand as banality and shallowness result from a lack of consciousness in any of the three domains (Ehrenfeld).

Currently, the environment has been most affected by our lack of awareness in these domains. In order to satisfy a desire to have and acquire more we cut down forests for land and resources, over-consume our water resources for nonessentials, reduce biodiversity and farmland through industrial agriculture and human development, produce considerable amounts of toxic waste and products through industrial manufacturing, and so on. Clearly, with just over 7 billion people on the planet, and a growing middle class, consumption will only increase. This though, is harmful to our species as it negatively affects vital ecosystem services that humanity and almost every other species on the planet depends on. According to the National Wildlife Federation, “An ecosystem service is any positive benefit that wildlife or ecosystems provides to people.” These include provisions like potable water, oxygen and clean air, food, medicine, and recourses such as wood and fibers. Other examples include crop pollination, decomposition and nutrient recycling, erosion and flood control, carbon sequestration, and climate regulation (National Wildlife Federation). Through our desire to grow and acquire more material goods, we have put added stresses on the environment to the point that we are degrading these important services, and threatening our species’ future.

Another source of our unsustainability comes from modern culture’s tendency to believe that technology can solve all of our problems, even when technology is the source of a problem. When faced with the issue of unsustainability our society tends to prefer the technological solution. Ehrenfeld describes our way of acting in his writing, “In our modern way of thinking and acting, we are accustomed to solving virtually every problem by some sort of technological means. By this I mean not only using some favorite artifactual device, but also by applying ‘scientific’ theories when all of the alternative means held in reserve also fail to work. Although solutions to the immediate problem may appear, this habitual way of acting has the insidious ‘side effect’ of producing serious deterioration of nature and our own humanistic capabilities. The long run of success of the technological fix has also led to unjustified expectations that such solutions can always be found,” (17-18). For example, this is true when considering the methods in which we try to address the problem of fossil fuel consumption by cars. We try to mitigate the problem by switching all cars to electric, but we fail to also address the fact that for every ton of car thirteen tons of toxic waste is produced . It should be evident that the fundamental solution to solve the issues created by technology is to reduce the need of certain technologies, especially those with a superfluous purpose.

To understand what motivates us to take certain courses of actions it is essential to breakdown the reasons behind such actions. In one of Aristotle’s better-known writings, he attempted to understand the way in which humans give meaning to manmade objects into four separate categories of cause. The first two causes were concerned with the object’s material and form, the third cause (efficient cause) was concerned with the process which conceived the object, and the fourth cause (final cause) was concerned with the meaningful purpose or end the object was created to fulfill (Aristotle). Ehrenfeld explained the relevance of Aristotle’s writings by writing, “Our present mentality exposes only his ‘efficient cause,’ that is, the one that connects a surface phenomenon (effect) to its proximate cause. Such causes are the essence of the reductionism of modern science and are the basis for the dominant forms of modern technology. In Aristotle’s terms, the causes related to sustainability may have more to do with the ‘final cause,’ that is, the end toward which one acts or uses some form of technological artifact,” (Ehrenfeld 61). So basically, many technologies that do lead to our unsustainability are not necessary to fulfill the many of the ends we may seek.

In order to reclaim a sense of genuine satisfaction in our lives; restore our sense of humanity, ethical responsibility, and place in the world; and environmental health; and understand what we really long for in our lives we must once more begin to embrace the orientation of being. Rabbi Micheal Lerner describes the key to this transformation in orientation in his book, The Left Hand of God, and says that we must, “Recognize that people hunger for a world that has meaning and love; for a sense of aliveness, energy, and authenticity; for a life embedded in a community in which they are valued for who they most deeply are, with all their warts and limitations, and feel genuinely seen and recognized; and for a life that is about something more than just money and accumulating material goods,” (Lerner). When Ehrenfeld gave his definition of sustainability as, “the possibility that human and other life will flourish on the planet forever,” (Ehrenfeld 6), he referenced Lerner’s quote in order to give a clear idea of what he meant by flourishing. He insisted that in order to escape the self-destructive patterns of behavior that lead to our unsustainability that it was essential to recognize this basic human desire, and that there are other ways to satisfy this need than through material consumption.

Like addiction, unsustainability can be resolved through the same basic process. The first step to bring the change necessary to end unsustainability is to bring its self-destructive patterns into view and increase awareness. The second step is to replace the modern vision of having a technologically filled future, for a vision of a stable future where we can know that our ￼descendants will have an equal chance to appreciate and enjoy the world just as we did. The third step is to change the underpinnings of behavior that bring about unsustainability with new, more sustainable underlying systems of society and culture (Ehrenfeld 8). But for the purposes of transforming society towards sustainability, it is first necessary that people understand how and why we are currently living unsustainably.

In order to allow our society to embrace the cultural values of sustainability in the long run, it is essential to increase awareness of the effects of our behaviors through universal environmental education. In Ernest Callenbach’s book, Ecology: A Pocket Guide, he wrote about the nature of a society’s voluntary evolution and writes, “At some returning points history, dominant values become exhausted or problematic, and people work out new values that they hope will enable them to survive better. During the rise of consumer capitalism, Western peoples adopted the belief that technology can solve all our problems and is the most important thing in life; religious and cultural matters became secondary,” (148). Certain aspects of culture in many cases serve as evolutionary adaptations, which is evident when one analyzes the purpose of certain traditions and cultural habits. Examples of this include the spiritual significance that certain cultures place on the animals or their environment. But yes, culture may be one of the most powerful tools our society and our species can use to achieve the state of sustainability.

In today’s society the line between resource accessibility and resource availability has been blurred. Every time we go into a supermarket we are frequently given the impression that resources are abundant as we always see rows upon rows of products that never seem to run out. This has led us to behave irresponsibly in managing our resources, as this perspective allows for greater ease in consuming and disposing of objects. William Blake wrote in Proverbs of Hell, ￼“You never know what is enough, unless you know what is more than enough,” (6). This statement applies itself perfectly to the context of consumerism’s effects on the environment. Many people consume, replace, and dispose of the things they have without giving it a second thought, but this is unfortunately a result of people’s lack of ecological consciousness.

Universal environmental education will undoubtedly influence the worldview the students to the point of increasing the ability to identify the variety of ways in which humans depend on a healthy environment, and how humans impact environmental health. After enough generations have had a qualitative environmental education, then culture will naturally move towards embracing sustainable values. This education must be comprehensive though and must include knowledge subjects such as ecosystem services, biodiversity, ecology, survivalism, energy and resource management, permaculture, and human impacts. Each successive generation will have an exponential awareness of the environment as each proceeding generation will also be aware and promote more sustainable practices and values outside the classroom.

Many people may be skeptical of the need to change, as they don’t buy more than what they need. Although these people do reduce their impacts, many of the products bought and sold in the developed world are inherently unsustainable. Many mass produced products are saturated with embedded energy and resources; meaning, that they usually produce many times more waste than the weight of the product itself, and take enormous amounts of fossil fuels to move that product from resource extraction, to production, then to distribution. In a global economy like we have today, resources from all over the world are sent to very distant factories such as those in China, and then redistributed across the world, consuming enormous amounts of energy at each step.
Another argument is that the whole world can’t possibly be educated effectively. This fact has been well proven as the United Nations did fail to meet their goal of eliminating gender disparity in education, but the countries with the biggest impacts on the global environment are the more developed nations. They consume the most, emit the most pollutants, create the most waste, and also promote the values of consumerism. These are the countries with the resources to educate their public on the issues of their unsustainability.

Hopefully, humanity will move to embrace the characteristics of a sustainable culture so that we may have a comfortable future where we will be given the opportunity to thrive. Maybe it will be a world where we take time in life to appreciate its small pleasures, maybe it will be a world where we grow the food we need in our gardens and where we can harvest water in the desert, maybe humanity will be a species that protects and promotes life instead of destroying it, or a world where we chose to savor human connections above possessions. But most certainly, it will be a world where we are allowed to hope, and know that tomorrow will be just as good as today, if not better.

Simple things like reducing water consumption or reducing plastic consumption are things that everyone should be able to do with extreme ease. Why then, do people still insist on buying bottled water or the like? 

I'm not asking people to cover their house in solar panels or stop showering altogether, but how can we make people care a little more so that they're willing to change damaging consumptive behaviors like wasting food, water, buying plastic bottles, leaving lights on, driving everywhere, etc...? 

The key is to make people care about their actions. Once they understand that their actions have consequences they'll begin to hopefully care and then they'll be able to change behaviors. 

However, ranting at people at pointing out the facts to them has little effect. I can show pictures of dying children in Africa all day to them, but that will not make them truly care. 

So how can we make people care about the environment? Do we have to constantly guilt-trip them into doing anything? Or is there a long-term way to change behavior?

False,Dogs have a higher eco-footprint than cars?,"  I was watching QI Series H House and Home Episode and Stephen Fry made the claim that it would be environmentally friendly to own a car and not a dog rather than the other way around. I was skeptical so I looked around and found the original article at www.newscientist.com. Not entirely a credible source but their conclusions are interesting nonetheless:

 ""a medium-sized dog would consume 90 grams of meat and 156 grams of cereals daily in its recommended 300-gram portion of dried dog food. At its pre-dried weight, that equates to 450 grams of fresh meat and 260 grams of cereal. That means that over the course of a year, Fido wolfs down about 164 kilograms of meat and 95 kilograms of cereals.

It takes 43.3 square metres of land to generate 1 kilogram of chicken per year - far more for beef and lamb - and 13.4 square metres to generate a kilogram of cereals. So that gives him a footprint of 0.84 hectares. For a big dog such as a German shepherd, the figure is 1.1 hectares.

Meanwhile, an SUV - the Vales used a 4.6-litre Toyota Land Cruiser in their comparison - driven a modest 10,000 kilometres a year, uses 55.1 gigajoules, which includes the energy required both to fuel and to build it. One hectare of land can produce approximately 135 gigajoules of energy per year, so the Land Cruiser's eco-footprint is about 0.41 hectares - less than half that of a medium-sized dog.

Doing similar calculations for a variety of pets and their foods, the Vales found that cats have an eco-footprint of about 0.15 hectares (slightly less than a Volkswagen Golf), hamsters come in at 0.014 hectares apiece (buy two, and you might as well have bought a plasma TV) ...""

Is this conclusion sound? I know there are many variables that are not considered within the text such as the cost of infrastructure for cars or even veterinarians to take care of pets but given the parameters of the text is it accurate? I've read a number of articles that have pointed out that pets do not consume meat that is produced on land exclusively for them. Rather they eat meats that are byproducts of human production but unsuitable for human consumption and therefore they have a lesser impact than NewScience suggests. Furthermore, I've also read that the numbers used to calculate the cars footprint are inaccurate and should actually be higher.

**What happens to the bodies of the animals that are euthanized at County shelters?**

Deceased animals are picked up by D&D Disposal, also known as West Coast Rendering, located in Vernon, Calif. The remains are rendered into animal by-products. D&D processes hundreds of tons of animal carcasses, tissues and by-products that would otherwise end up in landfills.


**What in involved in the rendering process?**

Rendering is a means of recycling animal remains. The remains are placed in large vats and heated to a high temperature in excess of 265 degrees Fahrenheit, at which point they become sterile and free of pathogens. Then a series of mechanical process occur that separate the fat, liquid, and proteins into separate collection systems.
The majority of rendered materials are remains of cattle, hogs, poultry, and sheep – the parts that cannot be sold for meat, leather, or other products. Other animal remains, such as butcher scraps, restaurant grease, fish, zoo animals, marine life, and animals from shelters are rendered as well.


**What happens to the animal remains – how are they used?**

The end results of the rendering process are tallow/grease and protein solids. Depending on the grade of rendered product and the markets the business sells to, the remains can be found in lubricants, polish, soap, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, gelatin, fertilizers, pet foods (from rendered livestock – NOT DOGS AND CATS), and agricultural feed.
The remains of animals rendered by D&D are made into a protein-rich product called “tankage” and are shipped to Asia where tankage is used as part of the local aquaculture. The tankage is used to feed shrimp, which in turn are fed to eels. Sometimes the tankage is used in hog and chicken feed.

The part that asks about accountability and responsibility.

Did you know that according to a report by the Bureau for the Appraisal of Societal Impacts for Citizen Information **(Coffee, behind the success story, 2018)**, in Peru and Ethiopia, each dollar linked to coffee exports in 2017 generated between 85 and 90 cents of hidden costs at the expense of these countries and their populations (the “societal costs”)?

**So what is Societal Cost?**  
**Societal cost (according to K. W. Kapp, 1963).**  
All direct and indirect, present and future losses and expenditure that are borne by third parties or the community as a whole due to the social, health and environmental impacts of production and consumption methods.

**According to the Bureau for the Appraisal of Societal Impacts for Citizen Information, the societal cost can be divided into 3 categories:**

1. The first component concerns producers’ inability to earn enough income to permit them — and their family — to live in dignity.
2. The second component of societal cost concerns local government spending on ensuring essential public services (education, healthcare, social affairs, water/electricity, transportation, justice, support for agriculture and environmental protection).
3. The final component of societal costs concerns the emission of greenhouse gases all along the chain, from the grower to the final consumer.

**To at least alleviate these challenges, the proposal is:**

1. Demand a living income for farming communities in developing countries.
2. Climate change may further marginalise more impoverished producers, as farmers with good access to capital and technology are more likely to manage emerging climate risk.  
So the private sector initiatives should share the costs and risks of climate-smart programs.
3. Lack of transparency around pricing is supported by antitrust laws that protect companies against sharing price information, translating into brands telling sustainability stories without an economic element. Consequently, consumer trust in brand stories around farming is distorted as consumers already believe they support farmers’ livelihood, which translates into less willingness to pay more and lower demand for change from the consumer side (SCA, 2019). Hence, demanding full sustainability around pricing is paramount.

We need a framework for sustainability that seeks innovations beyond environmental practices that focus on energy, water, natural resources, pollution and waste management **into** social-economic inclusion.

Stand with us if you too believe that a full-time coffee farmer should be able to make a living income from their farm revenue.

False,Fragility of Human Life," 

**Introduction:**

**With time the Modern Human life and living has become so fragile that the sustainability of Global Catastrophic events which ended many civilizations whose scientific and innovative powness is still a debate with no definite answers, is questionable. In recent times a minor incident like the Suez Canal blockage caused global turmoil affecting supply chains across half of the World.**

**Many events such as biological hazards (ex. COVID-19), prolonged droughts, increasing intensity of cyclones, earthquakes, etc do not have definitive answers for the community survival inclusive of the wealthy. Other natural events like Solar Flares, intensive EarthQuakes ( due to release of energy from continental plates), Tsunamis, etc are unavoidable and unpredictable ( as per technology available in 2020). The ability of the average human being to sustain is questionable especially in the developing countries which hold 60-70% of the World's population.**

**Electronic World & Realities:**

**In the 21st-century electronics and technology rule every domain of human life. E-money contributes to 90% of World wealth and 95% of World financial transactions. The wealth for which many politicians like Hitler, Stalin, and 90% of Modern World leaders kill, abuse, and betray the citizens & constitution on which they gain power, is just a solar flare away from becoming recordless.**

**Current administrative systems, record maintenance, crypto, etc are so dependent on technology that it will take a few seconds in an event of a solar flare ( which are cyclic & unavoidable in nature) for humanity to move to the stone age. While modern technology with nuclear sciences has developed enough potential to cause EMP destruction in limited geography giving enough potential for destroying several large cities in the World.**

**Hence the question arises about the fragility of human life in this modern era. The last known solar flare happened in 1859 where the World is least dependent on technology & electricity as it is now.**

**Hence people of all economic categories have to realize the importance of luxury as a prospect of survival through learning lessons from past mistakes. Except for the state of art defense facilities, not even hospitals are EMP proof considering 90% of equipment is dependent on electronic and electric circuits. Hence, a paradox always arises in what we are protecting and valuing.**

* **According to studies chance of solar flare affecting Earth is 12% in the coming one decade.**

**Food, water & energy - Future of Life**

**In modern-day living food, water and energy form the core of living. The three essentials occupy 30-40% of the net expenditure of a citizen globally. While the essentials occupy 80-90% of net expenditure in economically torn-up countries like Venezuela, Zimbabwe, etc. Average end consumer inflation of essentials stands between 10-15% in developing countries like India. Apart from financial implications, essentials are predominated by availability. On average malnutrition causes 1 million deaths annually and 0.2-0.5 million deaths are caused annually due to water pollution & shortage.**

**When we refer to classic history many civilizations inclusive of the Indus Valley in India have gone extinct due to prolonged droughts and rains. Current Global economies cannot last for more than 1 year in such an event in current times. Even a small event like 10 days of Suez canal blockage can contribute chaos to the supply chain and inflate the pricing by 10-20%.**

**Through the article, I wish to emphasize the fragility of life in the Modern World and the unpreparedness of the modern governance systems at par with historic times putting at risk the majority of the global population. Current macrosystems of management of water resources which involve lakes, reservoirs, etc have 50-60% evaporation factor in a country like India making them inefficient. Macrosystems in agriculture also contribute to water, soil, and air pollution due to excessive usage of agriculture chemicals & nutrients apart from producing just 40% of optimum yields in India. Macrosystems in energy (electricity) contribute 1 kg carbon emission for kilowatt (unit) of electricity to the end consumer with 15-20% as transmission loss in India.**

**Macrosystems are inefficient, expensive, and polluting. When resources like water & food which have limited availability become scarce with time the only way to increase the availability is through efficiency than capacity. In the current times of Global Warming, another resource that would be reducing with time would be the availability of land which results in an imbalance of food supply (60-70% global food inclusive of cash crops like sugarcane, cotton, rubber, etc are produced in coastal zones. Majority of which would be affected by rising sea-levels due to global warming.), forest area and settlement zones.**

* **According to studies top metropolitans & cities in the World are going to face an acute shortage of water by 2050.**
* **According to the UN, the World is going to face acute food shortages for the next 50 years due to the effects of global warming.**
* **According to studies, the average household consumption of electricity emits 14-25 tons of carbon annually which requires 3-7 acres of forest land to absorb.**

**Adulteration of resources- Economics over humanity**

**Adulteration of resources is one of the major contributing factors for crisis and chaos in modern human life costing annually trillions of dollars annually to governance bodies and individuals. The fascinating thing about adulteration is 50-75% of adulteration happens legally. The global emphasis on economics & power over human life has resulted in this scenario. Some of the important legal food adulterations are as follows**

1. **80-90% of honey available in the US is adulterated.**
2. **75-80% of antibiotics manufactured in the World are used in the poultry & dairy industry.**
3. **Genetically Modified crop varieties represent 60-75% of the modern food supply chain which intensify health effects like cancers, renal disorders, liver issues, etc.**
4. **The majority of modern foods contain high concentrations of sugars in many generic names like cane sugar, fructose, dextrose, corn syrup, etc causing diabetes, obesity, gastrological disorders, etc.**
5. **60-80% of freshwater resources globally are contaminated by chemicals way above human tolerance levels causing cancers, renal disorders, allergies, chronic diseases, etc.**
6. **Power fluctuations and interruptions globally cause individuals & companies hundreds of billions of dollars in loss of productivity, damage to systems, etc apart from causing considerable deaths annually.**

**Apart from the above the adulteration of resources is causing health chaos which in many cases results in the transmission of health ailments like cancers, allergies, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, renal disorders, hormonal issues, etc to future generations. The phenomenon is not only adding financial burden but also human pain & suffering to future generations.**

**Additionally, globally corruption, infringement of power centers by corporates, lack of testing facilities & enforcement, etc causing the adulteration to affect global citizen life, wealth, and well-being at a rapid pace.**

* **$150 billion USD- Annual Global cancer spending ( 10 Lakh crore INR)**
* **$400 billion USD- Annual Global diabetes spending ( 24 lakh crores INR)**
* **$8.8 Trillion USD- Annual Global healthcare spending (540 lakh crores INR)**

**The above numbers in most cases are a result of abuse of average global citizen health through adulteration of resources to make financial gains by corporates, individuals, even governments, etc. Through this article, every modern citizen equipped with treasure known as knowledge has to think about the abuse we are inducing on our health as well as future generations for the purpose of economic gains ( digital money) which is just a solar flare away to reach a recordless chaotic state. Is human suffering worth our greed?**

**Bio- Hazard - An unavoidable battle of evolution**

**Over the evolutionary history of Earth, many deadly microbes which are designated as Superbugs that do not have definitive prevention & curing techniques have been frozen for millions of years in permafrost and polar ice caps in a dormant state. These microbes which have been observed & studied through deep core samples have the potential to wipe out entire species in a very short time.**

1. **2016- Anthrax outbreak in Russia due to melting of Permafrost**

**Is a classic example of the potential of such an outbreak. With 17-20% of the global food chain dependent on seafood, biohazards through polar ice caps melting can do irreversible damage and adulteration to the food chain. This also gives microbes irradiated from the meltdown of ice caps to cause global scale pandemics through compromised food chains.**

**Apart from the above, the global community experienced a major outbreak of pandemic or epidemic every decade due to man-made events and natural genetic mutations of existent microbes. With every outbreak, the Global community lost millions of innocent lives and even 30-50% of the global population in certain cases. For every event of pandemic and epidemic, the only practical answer given by modern human beings is fear than the solution.**

**As usual, the moral-less society uses every emergency to exploit the pain of fellow human beings for financial gains (digital money) and power gains through vaccines, healthcare services, hyperinflation of essentials during emergencies, etc. With the destruction we are doing to the global environment for numbers known as economics which have no value when no human being exists, we are committing an irreversible crime against the very planet & its beings on which our existence is based.**

**Future of Mega Earthquake (India)- Greediness pays the price**

**India is unique in its geography. During evolutionary history when the last supercontinent Pangea has split to form the Modern World, the fast-moving Indian plate has moved inwards into the Asian plate forming the World’s largest mountain ranges we call the Himalayas. On average Indian continental plate moves 2’’ every year causing deformation and heavy stress-energy near the conjunction. Periodically the resultant stress-energy is released in the form of massive Earthquakes which can reach an 8-9 Richter scale with the potential to cause severe damage to the entire country.**

**According to many notable studies from reputed institutes like IIT’s in India and abroad the chances of Mega Earthquake is increasing exponentially with an increase in the buildup of stress-energy. While in practicality 75-90% of buildings in India are not Earthquake resistant and 6.5-7’’ Richter scale earthquake can cause deaths of more than 40-50% of citizens causing irreversible damage to the country financial system ( for which governance & people torture citizens).**

**While there is no definitive structural solution implemented and followed due to corruption and greed overruling the basic safety of citizens. There always exists a question beyond our greed clouded minds, how do we practically face an event which is unavoidable in nature.**

**Cyclones & Global Warming - Mates of destruction**

**According to studies, every 1° C increase in global temperature will result in a 2.5-5% increase in the intensity of cyclones. The intensity of cyclones not only cause havoc through force of wind but also result in heavy downpour causing flash floods capable of blowing away even the powerful dams on Earth (three gorges recent example).**

**With average global temperatures rising 1.5-2°c every 5 years puts at risk 60-70% of the global population who are coastal & coastal fed mega cities occupants. The Indian subcontinent has 4-5 mega cyclones in the year 2020 itself with the intensity of cyclones becoming stronger with every occurrence. According to reputed studies, the Indian subcontinent 2030-2050 will face extreme weather conditions like tornados & super cyclones at par with the US & Central America. 70-80% of the coastal housing cannot withstand the forces of wind and downpour as observed in the case of Hudhud in Visakhapatnam.**

**While our greed for economic gains and instant economic growth has hampered average citizen safety and right to life. There always arises a question: what is economics or greed without life and life with chaos.**

**Conclusion:**

**Through this article, I wish to bring to everyone notice the realities of the current World as per science and its future implications as estimated by science. The effort each one of us is doing in safeguarding our future and future generations are uphoulingly minimal. But the amount of greed and cruelty we exhibit for lifeless wealth generation, storage, and preservation is uphoulingly extreme.**

**Do the future generation deserve the lifeless wealth we are creating, killing the very life of future generations through destruction of natural resources, causing health crises, killing & abusing fellow human beings, etc. I always have doubt do we truly love at least our children, this is the topic for the next article.**",Human Society and Global Issues,Fear (Negative)

False,Brazil Gov't Looking to mine the Amazon,"While Brazilian rainforests burned the Brazilian Government was looking for ways to mine next to the Amazon river. 

Agriculture is incredibly important to Brazilian, therefore fertilizer is incredibly important to Brazil. I get they're concerned about fertilizer. The country currently imports over 80% of their fertilizer at a very large carbon cost. COVID has highlighted that supply disruptions are a large risk so Brazil was looking at fertilizer potential in Brazil. 

The Lake Peigneur Drilling Accident and the Bayou Corne Sink Hole are both excellent examples of why putting a giant salt mine next to the Amazon river is a bad idea. Then there's the impact to the indigenous people in the area who don't want it.

I can understand that agricultural is the largest lobby group in Brazil so they're going to push for fertilizer supply. 

I do not understand this desire to mine near the Amazon river. 

Verde Agritech is an organic fertilizer company in Brazil making a product that doesn't run off or leach, this is excellent for the periods of heavy rain that Brazil can experience in the rainy season. It also promotes drought tolerance by increasing the ability to retain water and pest resistance helping to reduce the use of harmful pesticides. Farmers are loving it and say so publically. Crops are bigger and better, plants are healthier. Said by the farmers. Soil diversity, and therefore resiliency, increases with it. 
The Verde Agritech fertilizer technology doesn't require the hazards of tailings ponds and it doesn't require the wasting of fresh water. 
Verde is committed to responsible sustainable development, they are reclaiming land, reclaiming rainforest, and have won environmental awards.

With companies like Verde Agritech able to safely supply fertilizer WHY is the Brazilian government looking at giant salt mines putting the Amazon river and it's ecosystem at risk?!? I DON'T GET IT. 

There are people trying to do things the right way to help with issues like sustainable food production, soil biodiversity, stopping fertilizer leaching, preventing rain forest destruction and then Government doesn't care. Just put the Amazon at risk. Clear cut and burn more rainforest. There are really good alternative options, bloody help them grow.

We started fighting climate change back in 1992 or so.  Since 1992 energy use increased > 50% and greenhouse gases went up 45%.  Electricity is 20% of energy use  in 2020 and will be 24% by 2040.  100% renewable electricity in 2020 = 20% of energy use.  Solar & wind are < 3% of global energy use in 2020.  20% of energy will be renewable by 2040 under ideal conditions.  Battery and wind rare earth demands will cause shortages before 2030.  To delay 1.5 C we have to reduce emissions 50% in 10 years.  China poured more cement in 2 years than the US in 100 years 2017 - 2018.  10 yrs clearing the skies of smog in China raised global north temps 0.1 C.  Renewables will not delay 1.5 C or reduce emission anywhere near 50% in 10 years. Food, water, supply chain shortages and pandemics will severely affect renewables.  Battery and bio-energy extraction destroys global lands, water and wildlife.  We have to double down on extraction from the areas needing protection most.

False,Environmental Impacts of Cattle,"Hi r/environment. I've been trying to read up on the impacts of animal agriculture, specifically for cows, and have been getting conflicting results. Some say that it's a massive polluter according to past studies, while others say that it only seems that way because the studies compared the entire lifecycle of animal agriculture to singular industries/activities. 

Still some people say that it's not the animals themselves, but factory farming that is responsible for the carbon footprint; while others say that regenerative grazing and holistically managed grazing can help make carbon neutral farming. 

I guess my question is, what are the different impacts cattle farming has on the environment? And are those effects due to the inherent nature of cattle, or are they due to the way we raise cattle through factory farming? If it's the latter, then is there a sustainable system for cow farming that is carbon neutral in the long term?",Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability,Fear (Negative)
False,Do we understand the current environmental problems?,"""Understanding our environmental issues will make us aware of their solutions. “Every contribution counts” says Gustavo Copelmayer. Environmental problems threaten our planet and the entire current and future population. Among the most pressing, are the ecosystems rich in biodiversity, water scarcity and pollution, air purity, soil desertification and, of course, climate change.

In recent years, we have witnessed progressive deforestation as a result of unsustainable agriculture and uncontrolled exploitation of wood. He points out that 70% of the earth's surface is covered with water but 97.5% of the water is from the sea, not suitable for human consumption. Additionally, we have the problem of water quality, which is making it one of the most precious assets of humanity. In fact, bad water is the cause of deadly diseases that affect all living beings, mainly children. For example, diarrhea accounts for 40% of infant deaths in an emergency, a fact that could be reversed if vulnerable populations had clean water.

Being aware of the preservation of water and oxygen, vital elements for life and health, is in our hands! ""We must emphasize the need to preserve water and be aware of events brought upon by climate change, since environmental problems also damage health,"".

With the increase in temperature, nature manifests itself in the form of rapid desertification, destruction of natural habitats, melting of the poles, extreme temperatures and the increase in natural phenomena such as typhoons or hurricanes. Climate change, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, FAO, is one of the most dangerous environmental problems, as it prevents sustainable development. Gustavo Copelmayer points out that it is also an obstacle to ending poverty and puts food security at risk.",Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability,Fear (Negative)
False,'COWSPIRACY: The Sustainability Secret' and animal agriculture discussion thread,"*Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret* is a 2014 documentary film (which is currently on Netflix) which explores the impact of animal agriculture on the environment, and investigates the policies of a few environmental organizations on this issue. The film looks at various environmental concerns, including global warming, water use, deforestation, and ocean dead zones, and suggests that animal agriculture is the primary source of environmental destruction. 

From the [[official website]](https://www.cowspiracy.com/):

>Follow the shocking, yet humorous, journey of an aspiring environmentalist, as he daringly seeks to find the real solution to the most pressing environmental issues and true path to sustainability.

Have many of the people here seen it? I've just watched it and am wondering what people here thought. 

Personally I think on the list of popular conspiracies, I think a minority are 'mostly true'. This includes the paid-for promotion of bogus and corrupt Food Guide Pyramids in the USA, the burying of climate change information and sowing of disinformation by fossil fuel lobby groups, and the dissemination of 'low fat' health disinformation by the sugar industries. After watching COWSPIRACY it seems that not only is it one of Life on Planet Earth's worst problems, it's one that is unrecognised by most of the world's population, and covered up by entire industries and entire governments. 

If I recall, 60% of mammal biomass on planet Earth is animal livestock, and 36% is humans, leaving only 4% to all wild mammals. I have asked a lot of people to guess percentages, and NOBODY has guessed that wild mammals are below 20% of the total. No surprise then that the water and methane from livestock dwarfs most other contributors to our GHG and water budgets yet goes unrecognised or underappreciated by even some of the largest environmentalist groups.",Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability,Fear (Negative)

The latter occupies a relatively small area of the anthropic cerrado, and the prospects for expanding into forest areas are limited (Costa, 2000; see also chapter 4)”

Animal agriculture is the biggest contributor to global warming that individuals can practically do something about, without fundamentally changing their lifestyle. Avoiding transportation is practically impossible for most people in our globalized economy. Avoiding transportation would also mean avoiding buying things that require transportation to reach you.

For instance, it has been estimated that the number of people fed in a year per hectare ranges from 22 for potatoes and 19 for rice to 1 and 2, respectively, for beef and lamb (9). The low energy conversion ratio from feed to meat is another concern, since some of the cereal grain food produced is diverted to livestock production. Likewise, land and water requirements for meat production are likely to become a major concern, as the increasing demand for animal products results in more intensive livestock production systems (10).”",Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability,Disgust (Negative)

**See The Power of Trees**

It has long been understood that trees and forests remain the best strategy humanity has for cleansing our atmosphere of the harmful greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, a key driver of global warming. Other technology like direct-air capture or CO2 separation have proven to be comparatively ineffective and far exceed the costs of just planting more trees.  


In their study titled *The Global Tree Restoration Potential*, Crowther Lab determined our planet could support 4.4 billion hectares of continuous tree coverage. With current global tree coverage sitting around 2.8 billion hectares, that means Earth could sustain 1.6 billion more hectares of forest. 

Of those 1.6 billion hectares, Crowther Lab discovered just under a billion hectares, excluding land occupied by agriculture and cities (about 1 trillion trees worth), inherently suitable for supporting reforestation efforts - that’s a land area almost the size of China.

Researchers [created a map](https://www.crowtherlab.com/maps-2/) that is the “first ever quantitative, spatially explicit map of the Earth’s tree carrying capacity.” They mapped global tree coverage (among many other metrics) and, most importantly, were able to pinpoint where planting trees would not only be feasible but the most beneficial to tackling “the problem of atmospheric carbon.”

The tree planting was carried out in Rutsiro District, Mukura Sector, with participation from 200 volunteers. Most of the trees were Grevillea Robusta (pictured below), a species preferred by farmers in agroforestry, used in planting with food crops because it is relatively fast growing and does not compete too much with other plants for water. The other tree type was tree tomato, which is exactly what it sounds like, an edible fruit tree. 

Overall, 380 acres were newly planted with these trees, which will be well cared for over time by the farmers who manage the lands.  About 4,000 additional trees will be planted here in the spring as a final part of the project, which will add lemon and avocado trees to the mix.

False,The True Terror of Climate Change: Part 1,"Intro:

&#x200B;

This isn’t something I take some sort of arrogant self-satisfaction in writing. In truth it is the most depressing thing I’ve ever typed out in my drawn-out youth of half-baked high-school poetry and pandering college essays. I’m writing this because I’m frustrated. I’m frustrated by a combination of two traditional narratives I often see in regards to discussing the impending ecological collapse we typically refer to as ""climate change"". The first is that there is hope to maintain the current state of things, always of the “just enough time to act” variety, and the follow-up assumption that seems to come with that is that communicating any sense of impending “doom” or “hopelessness” will dissuade people from trying to mitigate the disaster. Articles such as the following convey this attitude (and I hope to respond directly to this article soon) - [http://time.com/4731632/climate-change-2020-trump/](http://time.com/4731632/climate-change-2020-trump/)

Personally I don’t buy into either of these narratives. The following writing, however short or long it becomes, will seek to address these narratives while simultaneously revealing a more concrete truth buried within them both. 

&#x200B;

Part 1: The Problem: 

&#x200B;

Before we go into things like the politics or response efforts to climate change (and the wider issues of ecological collapse), let’s take some time to just examine the problem itself. In this section, we will look solely at the challenges facing the global atmosphere, how that ties into the biosphere, and the nature of the problems confronting both the natural world and wider human society. 

For most people, the entry point for understanding the environmental problems as a cohesive global issue comes from being introduced to climate change. The basic premise introduced is simple: humans are emitting CO2 in the form of fossil fuel consumption, that emission of CO2 is changing (warming) the climate, and that given a long enough scale, this problem will fundamentally reshape things like coastal communities or the ability to maintain agriculture.

Many see this as the end of the journey in understanding climate change. It present a clear issue, gives it a name, describes it in an elevator-speech type format, and provides a paradoxically simple yet complex solution to solving it: Humanity must emit less CO2 over time to avoid changing the climate too radically in order to maintain the status quo of the industrialized modern world. 

Unfortunately, this narrative is intensely limited. For example, it doesn’t touch on the idea that humanity emits a multitude of gasses into the atmosphere, many of which trap far more heat than CO2.

The factory farm system has added millions of bovine to the surface of the Earth that simply didn’t exist before, and the nature of decomposing societal waste in the form of landfills is also a modern creation of the past century. Both of these processes emit an enormous amount of Methane. This is important to note because Methane actually traps 100 times as much gas as CO2 in its first year of introduction, and retains roughly 72 times the amount of heat after 5 years. There is something to be said for the fact the Methane tends to dissipate from the atmosphere after 10 years, but its ability to accumulate over that time and our continued increase of its production has largely outpaced this dissipation. - [http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/) 

(how factory farming adds to climate change.) - [https://www.ecowatch.com/how-factory-farming-contributes-to-global-warming-1881690535.html](https://www.ecowatch.com/how-factory-farming-contributes-to-global-warming-1881690535.html)

Yet even with this understanding the severity of something as simple as 1 additional chemical is downplayed. Since methane tends to be seen as more of a “burst” of heating as opposed to the “sustained” heating CO2 leads to, there is an instinct to see it as less of a threat, or at least as less of an enduring one. What this ignores however is the nature of how this type of short-term burst of heating adds to the wider cycle of climate change. 

As Methane adds to the heating cycle, it gives a boost to the melting of arctic and sub-arctic permafrost in the regions of Alaska, Northern Canada, and Russia’s Siberia. This permafrost itself contains an unknowable amount of gasses, all trapped within the once permanently frozen areas of those regions. As these areas are thawed for the first time in 1000’s of years, they release the CO2 and methane stored beneath, thus accelerating the warming cycle in a way that is outside of human influence or control. The problem is pervasive enough that scientists continue to show larger-than-expected amounts of these gasses being released into the atmosphere from this process. - [https://phys.org/news/2018-03-permafrost-methane.html](https://phys.org/news/2018-03-permafrost-methane.html)

This process gives us an introduction to the wider problem of climate change, which is the nature of its intersectionality with the wider crises facing the World’s ecosystems. Still, taken in this view the common perspective often looks to the atmosphere itself as the source of both the problem and the solution. A deeper look shows how other environmental problems tie into this process. 

Let’s take de-forestation as an example. It is no surprise to anyone who passed 3rd grade science that plants take in CO2 emitted by humans and other animals, and that they in-turn release oxygen for our consumption. This understanding leads us to a natural conclusion: the more trees we have on the planet, the better we’ll be able to regulate the escalation of gasses like CO2 and Methane. Indeed, scientists have said for a long time that the global forest systems are the best means for mitigating climate change. - [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-best-technology-for-fighting-climate-change-isnt-a-technology/](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-best-technology-for-fighting-climate-change-isnt-a-technology/)

Unfortunately, looking into the rate of deforestation itself will show that we are only adding to the problem by clearing these necessary ecosystems, rather than helping to mitigate the disaster by protecting them. The amazon rainforest is perhaps the best example. Often referred to as “the world’s lungs”, it is the largest continuous area of tropical rainforest on the planet, and is responsible for 20% of all the oxygen inhaled by every living creature on the planet. 

Despite the overwhelming importance of this region, its destruction has gone largely unchecked, ironically pushed to exploit resources that add heat to the atmosphere or for the clearing of land for industrial farming. The fact that Brazil recently elected Jair Bolsonaro, a climate change denier (liar) who has promised to increase rainforest “development” and shifted control of the region from the country’s environmental agency to its agricultural one, shows that this problem has little chance of slowing. - [http://www.humanosphere.org/environment/2016/07/brazils-rising-deforestation-rate-shows-reversal-environmental-progress/](http://www.humanosphere.org/environment/2016/07/brazils-rising-deforestation-rate-shows-reversal-environmental-progress/)

(Bolsonaro transfers power over the rainforest to agricultural ministry.) - [https://www.agcanada.com/daily/bolsonaro-gives-brazil-farm-ministry-powers-on-indigenous-land](https://www.agcanada.com/daily/bolsonaro-gives-brazil-farm-ministry-powers-on-indigenous-land)

One could be forgiven for hoping that forest protection efforts or re-forestation efforts might help make up some of this difference. Depressingly though, this is not the case. The largest bio-spheres of the planet with the largest areas of forest cover have experienced massive forest lost since 2001 alone. The Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, lost 12 million hectares of forest cover in that 16 year period, with their single highest year of loss being 2017 itself at 1,470,000 hectares in a single year. For perspective, the total area of Michigan is 25,049,329 hectares. This means that the Democratic Republic of Congo alone has cleared an area of forest almost half the size of the entire state of Michigan in less time than it takes a human being to go from infancy to high-school graduation. Taken in conjunction with forest loss in other countries, the situation’s urgency begins to reveal itself. - [https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map) 

Still, not even this combination of factors is able to show the true all-encompassing nature of the environmental catastrophe we now find ourselves living through. To gain a wider picture of the problem, we should look beyond our own visible atmosphere and turn to the other 2/3rds of our planet: The Oceans. 

The World’s oceans absorb 35 - 42% of all CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, and over 90% of the excess heat caused by global warming. Their importance in mitigating and understanding climate change, and the nature of change that the warming climate will have on these ecosystems, cannot be understated. - [https://www.climatechangenews.com/2012/01/24/warming-oceans-face-co2-tipping-point/](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2012/01/24/warming-oceans-face-co2-tipping-point/)

This absorption has already begun to affect the oceans, despite the system taking about 20 - 40 years to fully react to the change. This delayed reaction means that, even if humans were to discontinue all CO2 emission today, the oceans would continue to change as a result of global warming for decades beyond that end. This is known as “The thermal intertia of the oceans.” - [https://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html](https://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html)

The nature of the change which has already taken place has been massively negative. Coral reefs have begun bleaching far more often than in previous decades. While bleaching events are a natural process, their increased rate means the reefs don’t have time to recover as part of the natural cycle, leading to massive die-offs of these “underwater forests” from regions such as the Great Barrier Reef. Naturally, this destruction removes sources of food for important parts of the marine ecosystem and adds to the global ecosystem’s inability to effectively react to industrial human activity. - [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/08/explore-atlas-great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-map-climate-change/](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/08/explore-atlas-great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-map-climate-change/)

While the death of massive amounts of marine life is obviously catastrophic for both the planet and our dependence on the Oceans, it’s not even the only story tied into the Oceans when it comes to climate change. Another effect is seen when we look at ocean currents, which are slowing and causing changes to weather patterns already. Indeed, global climate scientists have begun to ask whether the entire Ocean current system could “stall.” Since these currents help to power and carry everything from necessary rain patterns to hurricanes and cyclones, a change in these systems would have massive effects on human life. In fact, when hurricane Harvey hit Texas in 2017, the national weather service had to add a new color to their radar mapping system simply so they could accurately track the amount of water being dumped on the State. They had never needed to measure rain in that amount in that region in the modern history of weather analysis. - [https://e360.yale.edu/features/will\_climate\_change\_jam\_the\_global\_ocean\_conveyor\_belt](https://e360.yale.edu/features/will_climate_change_jam_the_global_ocean_conveyor_belt)

Hurricane Harvey color added: - [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546776542/national-weather-service-adds-new-colors-so-it-can-map-harveys-rains](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546776542/national-weather-service-adds-new-colors-so-it-can-map-harveys-rains)

Taken in conjunction with these problems, let’s finish by looking at how climate change can affect global weather patterns. While the hurricane example above is a good example to show how the change in the oceans from climate change helps propel a change in the weather, even this link is not a full view of the intersectionality which climate change represents. 

Perhaps the greatest immediate threat some developing countries will experience as climate change progresses isn’t the flooding of coastal cities, but rather the restriction or even complete eradication of water sources and localized water cycles. Many nations hosting millions of people rely heavily on localized water cycles for their populations. Pakistan, for example, requires snowfall in its northern region during the winter months in order to maintain its water usage, since the melting of this snow in those same mountain regions leads to massive water runoff which itself adds to and becomes the country’s rivers. - [http://glacierhub.org/2018/02/15/glacial-retreat-water-impacts/](http://glacierhub.org/2018/02/15/glacial-retreat-water-impacts/) 

This means that, should those regions warm to a point where that snowfall is extremely hindered or halted all together (as is widely predicted), the country would be left with an unknowable loss in water supply for its population of millions. Add to this the prediction that overall rainfall throughout the country is expected to decrease simultaneously with this loss of the glacial melting cycle, and you begin to paint a painfully dire portrait. - [https://www.geo.tv/latest/144615-pakistan-facing-worst-effects-of-climate-change](https://www.geo.tv/latest/144615-pakistan-facing-worst-effects-of-climate-change)

More on Pakistan: - [https://tribune.com.pk/story/682012/impact-of-climate-change-in-pakistan/](https://tribune.com.pk/story/682012/impact-of-climate-change-in-pakistan/)

This combination of diminishing rainfall and glacial runoff isn’t unique to Pakistan. India, the world’s most populous nation, is expected to feel many of the same effects. Additionally, the major rivers leading into China and Southeast Asia are largely sourced from Tibet and the Himalayas, an area of incredibly high mountains and sprawling natural glaciers. The Mekong river, the Yangtze, and many others find their source in this central region of the Asian continent. Yet the fate of those rivers and their water sources are cast into doubt as climate change hammers away at Tibet and drains the region of this naturally recurring and utterly necessary cycle. - [https://tibet-edd.blogspot.com/2012/03/tibet-and-climate-change-whats.html](https://tibet-edd.blogspot.com/2012/03/tibet-and-climate-change-whats.html) 

So where does that leave us? Well, hopefully this shows the impending nature of the climate catastrophe. Climate Change is not some vague idea or one that has limited effects, it is both propelled by and propelling countless other changes within systems that are vital to both human and ecological survival. Failing to understand the grand nature of this problem, its immediacy, and it intersectional elements has allowed cognitive dissonance around the issue to flourish. In order to move forward with even the most basic amount of optimism, we must confront the reality of what is happening, rather than seeking to downplay it in order to attract wider attention to the issue.

This urgency should be the engine to gain that wider attention.

False,Delhi Can't Breathe: Why Do Indian City's Have the Most Polluted Air on the World?," Every winter, the air of Delhi becomes an unbreathable morass. By some estimates, breathing one day of Delhi air when air quality is at it's worst is equivalent to smoking 44 cigarettes and the toxic air reduces life expectancy by approximately six years. The burden of air pollution falls especially hard on the elderly and infirm, and an entire generation is growing up breathing suffocating levels of pollution. According to the World Health Organization, Delhi is the most highly polluted megacity in the world, and three of the ten most polluted cities in the world are in the neighborhood of Delhi. In today's podcast episode, I discuss the agricultural origins of air pollution in Delhi, I discuss the non-agricultural sources of pollution, and the environmental Kuznets curve.

In a previous podcast episode, I discussed the [environmental ramifications](https://wealthofnationspodcast.com/the-rice-of-wrath-how-obscure-british-land-law-and-free-electricity-created-economic-stagnation-and-environmental-disaster-in-punjab/) of the green revolution.  One that I did not discuss was the air pollution created by the burning of rice stubble after the harvest. Modern mechanized harvesters leave a large amount of rice straw that needs to cleared before the planting of the winter wheat crop. The cheapest and fastest method to clear the fields is to burn to rice straw,  and more than 2 million farmers burn 23 million tons of rice residue over 80,000 sq km of farmland resulting in massive fires. As much as a third of the air pollution comes from these fires. Although the government has banned burning rice residue, the state governments have struggled to do so. For one thing, government policies such as [enforced sowing](https://www.pressreader.com/india/the-times-of-india-new-delhi-edition/20181020/281663960984871) times and large subsidies of mechanized harvesters only encourages more burning. The government has provided subsidies of 80% for the purchase of mulchers that process rice, but it is a slower process that costs 3 times more than burning the fields after subsidies are taken into account.

Many of the sources of air pollution come much closer to the city of Delhi. India is a major importer of Petroleum Coke, a by-product of refining heavy oils such as those produced in Canadian tar sands and emits twice as much sulfur as coal making it one of the most polluting sources of energy. The Indian government has announced a partial ban on the import of [petcoke](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-is-pet-coke-still-being-used-in-city-asks-hc/articleshow/67169254.cms) for 2018, although certain industries are exempt. Similarly, the rapid growth of diesel car use has had a strongly negative impact on air quality. The number of cars in Delhi has more than tripled over the last 8 years.  Moreover, between 2004 and 2014 the percent of cars sold in India that used diesel went up from one quarter of all cars to one half.  In 2014, the government of India phased diesel subsidies out, and demand for diesel cars has collapsed. Only 23% of all cars sold in 2018 are expected to be diesel. Finally, coal, the only natural resource India has ample reserves of, is a major contributor to air pollution. There are over a dozen thermal coal power plants surrounding Delhi and the largest Badarpur, had long been falsifying records on emissions to pass standards. The Badarpur powerplant, and many others are being [phased out](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/badarpur-thermal-plant-shut-for-good/articleshow/66228551.cms) to help reduce levels of air pollution.

One of the most important ideas for understanding air pollution in Delhi is the environmental Kuznets curve. The idea of the Kuznets curve is that levels of air pollution are lowest in low and high income countries, but much higher in middle income countries. India's rapid economic growth means it is rapidly approaching middle economic status has resulted in a massive increase in pollution. Many cities in the developed word such as Pittsburgh and Manchester were once famous for being the types of places where a person could go to work in a white shirt and come back in a gray one. It is a process we have seen in Beijing, which for a long time was considered the most polluted city in the world. However [since 2013](https://www.who.int/airpollution/data/cities/en/), Beijing and the Chinese national government has placed draconian measures to curb pollution. Coal use was cut by one half since 2013, and major construction and steel projects mothballed. Levels of air pollution are down by 20% since 2013. The experience of Beijing shows that the Kuznets curve isn't a natural inevitability, but the result of sustained changes in policy.

False,Calling all humans: Time to take action and end the global collapse of biodiversity,"The conservation of wild species around the globe is unquestionably necessary for the persistence of humankind. As individuals, we need to take responsibility for the global chaos that we've caused, and start reversing it by making more wildlife-friendly choices. The recently published Living Planet Report 2018 by the World Wildlife Fund reflects this, by documenting a 60% decline in wild animal populations over the last 40 years.

&#x200B;

Although this global collapse of biodiversity is devastating from a nature standpoint, humans often only call an issue into action when it threatens our own way of living. The benefits we receive from nature often feel far removed from out every day lives, seeming to be relevant for science, tourism, spirituality and nothing more. Once we start understanding that nature is the backbone of our health, economy, security and general livelihoods, then our motivation to push back against species depredation can fuel the large-scale change that is needed. 

&#x200B;

Whether its the 70% of medical drugs and treatments derived from natural resources, the 35% of global food production made possible through natural pollinators, or the protection we receive from coral reefs against storm surges and large waves from the open sea, we can't deny that humanity is largely dependent on nature's many services. Because of this, the conservation of the world's biodiversity should be on everyone's radar.

&#x200B;

We can think of biodiversity loss like a cake recipe. All of the ingredients come together to make one delicious dessert. If you lose an ingredient like sugar, the cake will still be a cake, but it might taste funny. If you also lose the flour, then your cake won't be much of a cake at all. Biodiversity is similar in that all species are part of a larger global system. If we lose one species to extinction, the effects will ripple down and weaken the entire network. The system might still function, but it won't be the same. If we lose even more species to extinction, then the entire system could fail. 

&#x200B;

The biggest threats to biodiversity and our earth's natural resources are agriculture, overexploitation, and energy development.



Agriculture is responsible for an estimated 80% of global deforestation,

and is driven by non-necessary dietary preferences and lifestyles of

the western world. We plow forests down for crop fields, and we allow

our livestock to graze and trample natural habitats down to the bare

bones of the earth.

&#x200B;

Overexploitation is a primary driver of species loss on land and at sea.

I'm sure everyone can remember the massive crash of Atlantic Cod

populations in the 90s, which was devastating for both nature and 

humans, destroying the marine life, coastal economy, and many

peoples livelihoods.

&#x200B;

Energy development is largely dependent on fossil-fuel burning,

which contributes to over 60% of our worlds carbon footprint. The 

impacts of energy development on biodiversity are less obvious to 

the untrained eye, but the green house gasses produced by this

industry are largely responsible for global climate change. Climate

change as a whole has huge impacts on wildlife activity, persistence, 

distribution and abundance across the globe. 

&#x200B;

As individuals, we can combat these industries by starting to make small changes in our every day lives. The following three changes are a good start.

&#x200B;

First, we need to fight mass-agriculture by harvesting our own 

small gardens, and choosing more sustainable meat sources; local is 

often the better choice.

&#x200B;

Second, we need to be conscious of where our consumer products 

come from, and refuse to support industries that thrive on overexploitation

such as mass- fisheries, or the palm oil industry; read product labels 

to inform yourself of what activities you are supporting. 

&#x200B;

Finally, make more energy-efficient choices; use more sustainable 

transportation, decrease energy use in your home, and avoid buying 

products that support massive energy development. 

&#x200B;

If we all start taking steps towards creating a more wildlife-friendly world, then governments, and industries will have to follow suit. We can spark the large-scale change that we'd like to see on our planet, and give our children, and grandchildren a more promising world to live in.

They’re right, we’ve been over-conditioned by social media for ideological addiction.

There is no uncorrupt form of government that has secrets. Secrets are for the rich and governents.

We don’t have time for war on 2 fronts, this is it, it’s now or never.

We need 100% private carbon dividends to fund a universal basic income and free health/education in Africa instead of war and slavery.

False,Human Extinction (Brought to You by Capitalism),"With the impacts of climate change already being confronted today and the catastrophes expected in the not-too-distant future, one would think that daily massive demonstrations and a restructuring of everyday life would be taking place all around the world. Is the threat of human extinction not a large enough impetus to snap the masses into action? The moral plague that is capitalism has paved the road to our extinction. The question now, and arguably the most important of our time, is whether or not we will address the ill-effects and effectively rid the world of the environmental destruction that capitalism has cast upon our world.  

Heavy-use of fossil fuels, industrial agriculture, and lifestyle choices are all aspects of the system that require analysis as we work towards minimizing humans’ contributions to climate change. One must note that these aspects are products of capitalism; they have caused the amount of degradation that they have due to the way in which world powers have adopted this exploitative system. Societies around the world must begin transitioning to renewable energy, switching to a farming system that is based upon [agroecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agroecology), and leading more humble, sustainable lives. Addressing all of these aspects are necessary and commendable starting points but stopping there results in addressing only part of the issue at hand. We must interrogate the entire system that has led to this; we must interrogate capitalism. 

Central to capitalism is individualism; the value of one’s self over (and especially at the expense of) the well-being of society and its people. A true democracy is necessary to effectively challenge corporations’ contributions to climate change. Democracy requires strong, organized communities, something that the toxic value of individualism directly threatens. Under capitalism, it is not the people who have the power, but the corporations and the 1%. Individualism has served as a distraction in the way that it has prevented the masses from joining together to protect the Earth and its people from exploitation. We must abandon individualism and work towards rebuilding our communities so that we are better equipped to challenge corporations that continue to lead us down the path of extinction. 

Another value central to capitalism – and equally as dangerous as individualism – is that of “competition” or Social Darwinism, the theory that fueled individualism. This theory provides people with reason to view the Earth as something that must be conquered. Today we often hear political commentators and guests on corporate news explain the importance of competition and its apparent link to innovation in society. According to these folks, humans are, naturally, always competing with one another. This view is very much anti-human, as humans require one another to survive. In order to be a “winner” in this competition, you must exploit the Earth, you must over-consume, you must actively work towards not cooperating with others and the world around you. In order to “survive” in this “competition” of life, you must produce not what you need, not what your community needs, but as much as you can until all of your resources are used. You must not consume what you need, rather you must consume until you no longer have the resources to do so. It is an odious cycle fueling our extinction.

These values are at the core of capitalism, and the institutions which our society revolves around are founded upon capitalism and its ideals. It is because of this soul-crushing system, and of course our impending extinction, that we must urgently come together and radically restructure society. We cannot rely on the workings of capitalism to save us from this threat, nor can we only address practices that are simply a product of this system. We must actively challenge all that we have been conditioned to believe and accept. We must recreate strong, unified communities. The masses must recognize their collective power and work together to challenge the few who are leading us to the end of human civilization.",Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability,Fear (Negative)

False,Behind the Walls of the West Bank - Could this Museum in Palestine Offer the World a Model for a more Sustainable Future?,"Hey Enviro-redditors -

&#x200B;

About a week and a half ago I started working at the Palestine Museum of Natural History and the Institute of Biodiversity and sustainability. I know, two things right? Firstly, that's one hell of a mouth full. And secondly, Palestine's got a natural history museum?!?!

**IMAGES:** [**https://imgur.com/a/BJFHBl6**](https://imgur.com/a/BJFHBl6)

Yes - to both. The museum's pretty small, with between 5 and 10 volunteers and staff at any given time. It's been running for about 4 years and is the brain child of the Director Dr Mazin Qumsiyeh and his wife Jessie. They started the project with a lump sum of their own money and now have the support of the Museum of Bethlehem.

&#x200B;

The idea behind the museum is to create a better understanding of the natural environment in order to reduce conflict between Palestine and Israel. The whole complex run off 100% solar energy, maintains and grows food and fish with Aquaponics systems, builds using recycled materials (such as plastic bottles and other building materials that have been thrown away) and runs at virtually zero waste capacity.

&#x200B;

It's a story of how one academic from Bethlehem decided to set a model for peaceful and sustainable living in the face of occupation by founding a museum. With the help of hundreds of international volunteers, bringing skills from aquaponics expertise to fine art, civil engineering, and even a computer programmer from MIT, Mazin and his wife Jessie are creating an oasis of sustainable technologies, ecological and cultural conservation initiatives, and a place of learning for the people of Palestine. A twenty-first century Garden of Eden, if you will.

&#x200B;

the Museum functions largely as a research centre focussing on nature conservation, biodiversity, natural and cultural history, human environmental health and organic agriculture. Given the precarious political context the museum exists within, it quite rightly boasts it's native botanical garden, permaculture, beekeeping, greenhouse, aquaponics and hydroponics, ecological pond, and animal rehabilitation efforts.

&#x200B;

The idea of a museum to research and document the flora and fauna of Palestine came from the Director's uncle, Dr Sana Atallah, the countries first zoologists who did research on the mammals of the eastern mediterranean.

&#x200B;

One of the largest obstacles we face is that people either don’t know the museum exists, or they're concerned about the security of visiting Palestine when in neighbouring Israel. I’ve been tasked with trying to grow the museum's online presence in order to get word out and hopefully show it to potential visitors and volunteers from around the world.

False,Roundup Megathread,"The recent court decision against Monsanto had fired up discussion around Roundup yet again. The usual suspects are still pushing the view that there is no link to Cancer.

If the mods are cool with it, I will be posting a lot of analysis of the huge list of links often posted by Monsanto cheerleaders and also the most current research articles which are generally not included in the 'Review Articles' they rely on for their claim.

If you have journal access and want to help, please post the text (or post the PDF on docdro.id) of articles I post about and if you are currently involved in scientific research or statistics or grad studies, please feel free to interject with your knowledge.

The court case Dewayne Johnson vs. Monsanto did not decide on the 'science', it decided on weather Monsanto knew about the toxicity being higher than it claimed and that Monsanto actively misled the EPA, researchers and the public about it.

I hope this is profitable for everyone. The argument that 'Roundup is better than the alternatives' is not a valid one. Non-toxic agriculture is the only sustainable option and must be our goal if we are concerned about the environment which we rely on for life.

PubMed is the main repository for all scientific research being published, you can search it easily but not all articles are publicly viewable, most only show a summary called the 'Abstract'. Here is the search result for 'Roundup':

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/?term=roundup

For non scientists I will explain some of the technical stuff here and update it as we go along. Firstly I would like to address what a 'Review Article' or 'Meta Analysis' is in science. Their argument relies heavily on these but as you will see, they are not as impressive or powerful as they pretend. So you know, I am a seasoned Developmental Biologist, I know this stuff inside and out. I am however semi-retired so I do not have easy journal access. If you want specific answers and you have the paper, please include full quotes from it. Statistics are not my strong suit so don't expect answers on p values etc. You will quickly find that this is no longer a matter of statistical significance (or insignificance) anyway.

**Review Article or Meta Analysis** are when a research group or regulatory body look over the available research to make an overall decision. Usually, each group applies their own areas of expertise to the analysis and reports about the general overall findings. Very few groups consider every available paper, criteria are set and they pare it down to a short-list of comparable studies. This is all very normal, every feild of research has such analysis, not just controversial topics. Often, reviews or meta analysis are done by grad students padding out their publication lists but in this case because it's controversial, there are many high profile regulatory agencies which have also put in their two cents.

You will notice that each review can only look to the past. Current studies and future studies are obviously not accounted for. It's logical that most of the reviews will be chosing their list of articles from the same pool, so we all have to understand who authored those studies. As Monsanto published virtually all studies related to safety to gain approval from varios regulators, the earliest studies were designed and conducted 'in-house'. Until 2000, Roundup was protected by patent so studies done outside of Monsanto were done by permission and the articles were approved by Monsanto before publication. This is why I use the term 'designates'. After Roundup came off patent, the first few years of research articles were mostly various independent groups copying Monsanto protocol to double check results. Not until about 10 years ago did independent research begin actually studying it's effect on us and other creatures in our environment. I explain this because any analysis of published research before about 2010 would be looking at a very shallow pool of research, mostly generated by Monsanto or their designates. 

As you may surmise, analysis of the same shallow pool of articles would be *expected* to yield the same result.


**Non-Linear Dose Response** is a term used for substances whose action does not fit the usual logic of ""more toxin = more toxicity"". First described in chemistry in the 80s, then medicine in the 90s, researchers found that some therapeutic drugs did the trick at minute doses, soon Toxicologists studied the concept in relation to toxins and found the same thing. Endocrine Disruptors are the famous ones. Hormones in our bodies have massive impact on physiology but are only produced in minute amounts. Chemicals which mimic hormones like Estrogen Mimics are now known to have a big effect even at low dose. Why this relates in this discussion is due to the fact that before about 2003, the nonlinear dose response was not even looked at.

>**Since its initial sales in the 1970s, the herbicide glyphosate attained widespread use in modern agriculture, becoming the most commercially successful and widely used herbicide of all time as of 2016. Despite a primary mechanism that targets a pathway absent from animal cells and regulatory studies showing safety margins orders of magnitude better than many other, more directly toxic herbicides, the safety status of glyphosate, has recently been brought into question by a slow accumulation of studies evincing more insidious health risks, especially when considered in combination with the surfactants it is usually applied with. Current, official views of respected international regulatory and health bodies remain divided on glyphosate's status as a human carcinogen, but the 2015 IARC decision to reclassify the compound as Category 2a (probably carcinogenic to humans) marked a sea change in the scientific community's consensus view. The goal of this review is to consider the state of science regarding glyphosate's potential as a human carcinogen and genotoxin, with particular focus on studies suggesting mechanisms which would go largely undetected in traditional toxicology studies, such as microbiome disruption and endocrine mimicry at very low concentrations.**

False,"Why should we, the people, be more involved?","We are facing an issue which is called water scarcity. Even in countries you wouldn’t expect any scarcity, like Sweden, water is actually short. Due to wildfires communities only have access to a rationed amount of water. The consequences range from heat strokes to people dying due to uncontrolled fires. Furthermore, aid from other European countries is tremendously important to fight the catastrophe.

*Water treatment is highly undermined*:

The global water supply, treatment, and distribution sector is a critical enabler of our society and has been so since the dawn of time: it guarantees our food, sanitation, health and well-being. Without it, the global economy would not be sustained. Global trends forecast a 55% worldwide growth in water usage by 2050, due to growing demands from manufacturing, thermal electric, agricultural and domestic sectors.

However water is needed more than ever, water treatment is still highly undermined. Currently there is a lack of comprehensive insight into the way available water sources are handled and many countries face challenges when it comes to restoring the quality of EU waters to acceptable levels. 

Water recycling is today minimal, however, water scarcity is already a serious problem in 11% of the European territory and is expected to grow to 30% in 2030.

Apart from the availability of fresh water, the overall water quality will be degraded as a result of seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers, faster depletion of dissolved oxygen due to higher water temperatures, and higher content of pollutants that flow into water bodies following extreme rain events.

Systems to gain further insight into the water system, solutions to deal with disruptive climate change events, as well as novel technologies and strategies, will be needed to optimize management of global water sources and make sure that sufficient water of an adequate quality is be available for to our societies.

I went to UofMN in Minneapolis and got a degree in Theater because I finished most of that degree while I was still in high school.  However, even during my time at the university, I was hoping to add a minor in sustainability or ecology or something useful.

False,The Biggest Lie Greedy Businesses Like To Tell,"The truth is - We are discovering new resources far quicker than we are consuming old ones, and we have more than enough here on planet earth for every single person to live in abundance (without doing any more damage to the environment).
Most people believe the opposite to be true because the resources we traditionally rely on like oil, coal and steel are indeed running out (non-renewable). We still rely on non-renewable resources because until just recently that has been cheaper. But we are discovering renewable resources rapidly because our awareness about the damage we are causing with traditional methods has spurred on scientists to look for more sustainable alternatives.

The fact is that since the scientific revolution (and the invention of money and credit) whenever we have wanted ANYTHING, we’ve put ourselves to the test to create it. Here are some epic examples.

- To solve world agriculture problems we literally learnt to make ammonia (to enrich soil) out of THIN AIR!
- We turned tungsten (a then useless metal) into light bulbs and changed the world forever!
- To free ourselves from needing slaves and relying on our muscles, we invented engines and motors.
- So we could stay connected, we turned copper into phone lines.

I know what you are thinking, what about today? Surely we are out of ‘inventions’? What do we want now?

Leading scientists (like Neil Degrasse Tyson) speculate that we know less than 5% of any given field (loads of room for new discoveries).

- Elon Musk is commercialising renewable clean energy with Tesla and Solar City (seriously google it, he is insane).
- Globally, through ITER, we are replicating the technology of the sun (to make almost infinite energy with no emissions)
- We can turn soybeans into graphene and use that to build bridges or filter seawater to make clean water.
- AI…
- Immortality…

So why do we still rely on old resources? Well, it is frankly still cheaper and God we are so resistant to change, at every level, from the individual to the multinational corporation. But we can make a big difference and some people are…

One of the big reasons that we personally haven’t been able to influence change is we keep consuming the things we don’t actually like and we are not investing in the solutions we’d rather have. The crazy part is – you know what solution you want (anything that helps make things better for everyone) and those people who invest in the solutions are getting wealthy! Here’s how real change makers help us shift to renewable resources.

AWARENESS – Notice anytime you buy something and then resent the purchase. Doesn’t matter what it is – from one-time use plastics to a gym membership to car insurance. Whatever it is, the fact that you resent it means that you would love a better product.

ACCEPTANCE – Whatever it is that annoys you personally, at some time not too long ago, we really wanted that product. For all of history we dreamed of something as beautifully practical as plastic so we created it. What we have today is the dreams of yesterday but what you want is a dream of the future.

ALIGNMENT – We can’t (and shouldn’t aspire to) go back in time. We can only go forward and to do that we have to be attracted to a better solution. Someone out there is already working on this solution and will create it – profitably. The job of a change maker is to support them. Not to fight against the ‘bad guys’ but to support the good guys!

ACTION – Support the best by investing in them. Easy. By investing in them, you whelp them succeed but when they succeed, you personally profit. YouTube Egoistic Altruism for an enlightening video about how your personal success helps others succeed too.'

One thing I personally resent is paying for petrol, car maintenance and car insurance. However, in the not too distant future it will be cheaper for me to not own a car and just press a button to have a driverless solar powered car pick me up and drive me wherever I want to go!

Creating new resources today is literally like creating ammonia out of thin air! We are entering the God Mode of science and we can do anything we put our mind to if we cooperate…

But how do we cooperate? We need to learn to trust each other! Now how do we do that? Well, so far, today the most universal, most efficient system of trust that we have ever created is money! One day we will have something even better, but even Bitcoin is just money (a more trustable money).

I’ll be sharing more about how money is going to play the key role in helping create sustainability soon. Basically, any endeavour that we make to create a sustainable future must be profitable. So before ever supporting any good cause again, or investing in an organisation that is going to create a revolutionary breakthrough with a new invention – do yourself (and the world) a favour by learning how to invest money so that you guarantee that you never loose. It’s not impossible, it’s just knowledge. Rich people are doing it today, so you can do it too!

If you enjoyed this article, let me know about the last thing you bought that you resent buying and I’ll endeavour to reference it in the next article and I’ll also send you a link so you don’t miss it.

I decided a few months ago that I wanted to be an Environmental Engineer for my career. Or perhaps an Bioresource Engineer. Almost entirely because of the fact that I cared for the environment so much. To that effect, I choose to also take an AP Environmental Science course in my high school.

Apparently by the year 2050 its said that most if not the entire developed world and a lot of the developing world will be using wayyyy more sustainable energies and technologies. Most of the greenhouse gas emissions are said to come from developing countries yes but those countries are all becoming more environmentally conscious too. I decided to go vegan because I learned that animal agriculture used a massive amount of water and contributed heavily to the greenhouse effect. But then I'm told that its effect is a lot less than I suspected. Apparently the 3 feet increase in sea levels isn't nearly as catastrophic as I thought it'd be in the coming decades. Temperatures are supposed to rise yes and human activities have caused the Holocene Extinction but it appears like everything else I thought I knew was exaggerated so why should I trust myself here?

Basically I'm just losing my motivation here. I thought I was kinda making a huge difference with what I'm intending to do. But according to all sources the world will be just fine in 2100 with the path we're headed. Every single day new technologies are being used to better manage our energies and waste. I have little doubt that there will be methods in the future to reverse a lot of the changes that will result from the minimal warning. Seems like the damage has already been done and can't be altered with respect to a massive extinction event pushing millions of species out of their habitats.

“Water security is one of the most tangible and fastest growing social, political and economic challenge faced today.”
World Economic Forum (2016)


1. Water Risks is an Increasing Concern 
By 2050, the world’s population is expected to reach 9.7 billion. It will be 11 billion by 2100. All these people will need water to meet their most basic needs. Agriculture, industry and domestic life rely on the abundant supply of safe water. However, this is by no means guaranteed and unpredictable water quality and availability represent one of the decade’s top emerging risks. 
Freshwater risk management is complex to assess. Such difficulty stems from the paradoxical nature of water: it is plentiful to many yet its scarcity affects hundreds of millions of people, it is both fossil and renewable, it is freely supplied by nature but its treatment, distribution, and wastage have a cost. 
Water risks are often underestimated, disregarded or simply ignored. This results in a global lack of preparation for future impacts and has implications for the world’s population, as a majority of water risks represent externalities which are not properly assessed. Consequently, all research and reports identified future concerns, especially in the following areas: 
■ World population will have to respond to a growing frequency and severity of losses; 
■ Awareness levels could be improved and drinking water will have a role in increasing understanding; 
■ The World need significant innovation in drinking water by directing big investments into innovative projects, technologies, and asset lines. 
■ The difficulty to assess future water risks is emphasized by the advent of new technologies and big infrastructure projects the eventual effects of which are as yet unclear.


2. What Are the Risks? 
A number of water risks are considered in this paper, including the impact of scarcity, pollution, water-related illnesses, treatment and topics of social, political and economic interests. 
Natural resources are unequally distributed around the world. Physical water scarcity, or the literal lack of water, is gradually worsening in many areas. Economic water scarcity from lack of finance or inadequate water management will lead to the rapid depletion of usable water resources. Such shortages will inevitably have implications for a wide range of insurance lines of business: property, agriculture, casualty, life, and health.
Ensuring clean water supply is a key to socioeconomic development. A failure to deliver or maintain a clean water supply can be inhibiting for any society. Many emerging countries are less capable of treating their water due to insufficient economic means. Water treatment in developed countries is subject to increasingly stringent regulations and quality standards to address pollution. Furthermore, treatment plants are considered as critical infrastructure that can potentially disseminate toxic products on a large scale as a result of human error or terrorist attack. Such a large scale event in a major city could seriously impact the world’s population.


3. Water is plentiful on earth, yet scarcity affects hundreds of million people worldwide.
Only 3% of global water resources are in the form of freshwater (in glaciers, ice caps, groundwater, lakes, soils, rivers, atmosphere and within living organisms); 97% is salt water in the oceans. Humanity does not lack water as such but faces shortages of fresh water readily available for consumption. This is aggravated by uneven geographical distribution, erratic supplies, and evolving trends in worldwide water patterns. 

4. Water resources: both fossil and renewable
Water moves continuously between different reservoirs, following a natural hydrological cycle. The turnaround time of water is about 10 days in the atmosphere and a few weeks in rivers, which makes it effectively renewable. On the contrary, water replacement in deep aquifers can last for hundreds to thousands of years: it is a non-renewable fossil resource (like oil) when withdrawals exceed the annual recharge. The increasing human demand gradually takes its toll on fossil water, some resources are already depleted at rates far superior to their replacement times. 

5. Water is free, but treatment, distribution, and mismanagement have a cost
Access to water from rivers, wells or dedicated infrastructures is generally free but this water is often unsafe if untreated. On a larger scale, industries, services, and agricultural structures rely on water as a cheap and abundant resource. Yet they often operate without a clear consciousness of the impact of their individual operations on the environment and on other users. A largely unsuspected price (“the true price of water”) includes treatment and distribution and extends to the cost of leakages, evaporation, contaminations, inefficient usage and wasteful practices. 

6. Water brings life, yet it can kill
 
Since it sheltered the emergence of life 4 billion years ago, it has been irreplaceable for humans’ survival and basic needs (drinking, food, sanitation, and dignity). But unsafe waters impact public health through contamination and spread of infectious diseases. 

7. Water: a public or a private asset?
Even though water supply is a key political issue for every government and community, it is often treated and distributed by major corporate companies whose objective is profit. The decision on water management is always a local compromise between the various stakeholders and the society as a whole. 

8. Water is a global issue, yet management is local
Water is at the same time a shared asset and a common cause of risk. It is usable countless times by different actors in different locations, provided that those usages do not impact on its quality or availability for the next user. But unless mutual coordination and respect of others are upheld, sharing water may trigger liabilities and conflicts.

9. Water projects generate development but may induce concerns 
Water supports the dynamics of human societies. Major cultures and civilizations developed in direct proximity to water sources. Good water management greatly enhanced the growth of communities. New technologies are still being introduced to master water resources: desalination plants, water recycling, nanotechnologies. 

 
“There is no substitute for water”
Rattan Lal, Director of the School of Environment and Natural Resources, Ohio State University

10. Origins of Water Scarcity and Expected Developments 

Water scarcity originates from the deficiency in water availability to meet the different users’ needs and can take different forms: usage exceeding resources, limited access to resources due to the lack of infrastructure, to inadequate sanitation or to pollution. Water scarcity results from a complex interplay of multiple factors. The physical absence of water is the most obvious cause, but poor water management and anthropic causes are contributing to a greater and greater extent.

 11. Type of water resources 

Different types of renewable water resources need to be distinguished:
- Blue water is the part of rainfall going directly to rivers by runoff or infiltrating into the ground to feed the aquifers and it is a major renewable water resource. 
- Green water is the part of rainfall temporarily stored into the upper soil layer, and taken back to the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil and transpiration of vegetation and it is another major renewable water resource. 
- Ice, by melting and it is renewable if new snow compensates each year for the melted part. 
- Apart from these renewable water resources, Fossil water stored in aquifers is non-sustainable ‘blue-water’ groundwater stocks are increasingly tapped into and will eventually run out. 


12. New technologies and Innovations 

As the need for water treatment is growing, new technologies are being developed. Desalination is an emerging process increasingly used. It is more energy intensive than traditional water treatments and, because of its cost,
 is only adapted for dry regions. Large projects are developing in the Middle East, in the US, Australia, and Europe 
Other alternatives aim at reducing the environmental impact of water treatment.
Treating large quantities of reused water to make it drinkable again would require enormous amounts of energy: 
for that reason and for cultural ones – event treated, some people have trouble accepting the fact that they are drinking wastewater – it is still not acceptable at an industrial scale. Advanced technologies permit individual drinkable water reuse. Point-of-use water treatment systems, i.e. portable water purification devices, can cleanse drinking water at an affordable cost in individual homes or commercial establishments. Decentralized treatment systems offer an interesting alternative as they require less investment and simplify the access of households to wastewater treatments.

13. True cost of water 

The true cost of water is a key starting point. It looks beyond just the price of the cubic meter as it encompasses also monetization of water related risks having already materialized for cities and industries while looking as well as indirect costs and missed opportunities. 
Indeed assessing the true cost of water is not straightforward and includes several aspects: 
1. Direct costs: Water price, cost of treatment plants and of other infrastructures. In Europe the price of potable water to the public varies from 1€/m3 (Italy) to 6.4€/m3 (Denmark). The water resources available and the state subsidies vary from one country to another. 
2. Indirect costs: Such as cost of public relations, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), lawyers, fines. 
3. Risks impacts: Such as remediation costs and downtime in case of pollution, drought, flooding. 
4. Missed opportunities: Positive impact of good water management in terms of investors’ attractiveness and opportunities in creating new revenue streams by selling treated wastewater to third parties for reuse. It includes as well new financial opportunities to capture, such as negotiating better insurance premium when mitigating risks and enhancing resilience & robustness.

14. The World need innovative approaches and solutions 

•Technological solutions 
•Smart investments 
•Integration with other functions 
•Instead of reïnventing the wheel, let’s learn from nature 

15. Blue Planet, Scarce Water 

We live on a watery planet, but less than 1% of all that freshwater is available for ecosystems and human use in
rivers, lakes, and aquifers. Yet, these life-giving freshwater systems face a host of threats from over-abstraction, 
fragmentation, pollution, climate change, and the ever-increasing demands of a growing population. 

16. Water for Drinking 

Healthy freshwater systems provide drinking water. In fact, while we need only drink 3-5 liters per day to 
remain healthy, the food we eat, clothes we wear, the energy we consume and products we use daily 
take tens of thousands of liters to produce.
A systemic and cross-sectoral ‘urban ecosystem’ approach is needed to design and implement
solutions to the multifaceted challenges. The main objective of this priority is to help design, implement and upscale
place-based and people-based transition pathways towards resilient, sustainable, low-carbon and resource efficient urban area.


17. Next step

We need to launch our eWATER solution to raise international awareness about the importance of water and identify strategies to raise the awareness of our clients and consumers. Advanced technologies permit individual drinkable water reuse. Point-of-use water treatment systems, i.e. portable water purification devices, can cleanse drinking water at an affordable cost in individual homes or commercial establishments. Decentralized treatment systems offer an interesting alternative as they require less investment and simplify the access of households to wastewater treatments.


18. eWATER solution - revolution

We at Zero Carbon a smart water tech startup, are dedicated to environmental preservation by developing and deploying societal and disruptive technologies. Our mission is very ambitious – we want to provide safe and clean drinking water to all world population every day, anytime and anywhere. Without any extra infrastructure at an affordable cost.

Picture this, a water ATM in the middle of the busy city, on a busy street that produces the purest, high-quality pure drinking water available today. Out of air. The water produced is not only pure and free of any contaminants but also beneficial to your health. Our consumers pay per use with coins, mobile payment or smart wearables linked to blockchain smart contract.
We can supply world population with most important substances on earth the drinking water. 




 “Without major technological innovations there is little hope of bringing the water equation into balance. There is no doubt that many technological changes can help improve services for millions and reduce the stress on water systems around the world.”
                                                                                                                   The World Water Council 



How it works
eWATER is a pay per- use drinking water refill ATM system. As the name implies, is a sort of a water vending machine except that in a water is produced out of the air. The water produced is not only pure and free of any contaminants but also available on demand 24/7 all year around. 
Our consumers pay per use of drinking water before refill bottle they have. 

They pay with coins, use mobile payment or smart wearables linked to blockchain smart contract. Payment goes into the machine in return for water. 

These machines are built, owned and operated by ZERO CARBON. The water ATM is providing safe and clean drinking water every day, anytime and anywhere. 

This concept will totally reduce the financial burden of the government cost of the water infrastructure. 

We will provide drinking water to people in the range of 10-20 cent euro (€0.10 – 0.20) per 1 liter on a pilot basis.

eWATER ATMs have the following advantages for consumers:
•	24 x 7 provision 
•	Water quality accountability and control
•	Pay-per-use methodology
•	Price transparency and flexible purchase
•	No Water Shortage
•	Eliminate overuse of PET bottles
 They also benefit project stakeholders as follows:
•	Off-grid functionality and environment-friendly
•	Low O&M requirement ensure water fee is affordable
•	Information layering (through cloud connectivity) for accountability (tracking each user transaction)
•	Service optimisation by monitoring key process parameters real-time online
•	Adaptable to various location types (streets, outdoor community spaces, school, hospital, etc.
•	Potential for targeted subsidies
•	Increases social impact

False,Ecologist Says Blockchain-Enabled Crypto-Governance Could Save the Environment,"Posted by Giulio Prisco

Bitcoin and blockchain technology are all over the press for the recent, apparently unstoppable surge of bitcoin price. But blockchain technology is also in the scientific press, with articles published in the prestigious journals Nature and Science, which cover possible important roles of blockchain technology for environmental issues.

Writing in the prestigious journal Nature, Guillaume Chapron, an ecologist at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Riddarhyttan, argues that “The environment needs cryptogovernance.” According to Chapron, blockchain technology can support sustainability by building trust and avoiding corruption.

“If humans repeatedly fail to build trust, perhaps algorithms should replace them,” says Chapron. “The environmental crisis is growing partly because of a lack of trust — the increasing distance between multiple actors who are unknown to each other, from companies and governments to individual consumers, creates many opportunities for fraud and failed policies.”

“The time is ripe for ‘cryptogovernance’, in which trust, law and enforcement are outsourced to computer code. For sustainability, blockchain technology could be a game-changer. It can generate trust where there is none, empower citizens and bypass central authorities. It could also make existing institutions obsolete, including governments, and raise fierce opposition. Laws could be replaced with ‘smart contracts’ written in computer code.”

According to Chapron, the potential benefits of blockchain technology for protecting and managing the environment include:

1. Certifying ownership of natural resources. For example, a certificate stating a community owns a forest can be logged in a blockchain with a time stamp and verified. 

2. Tracing physical goods throughout their life cycle, and tracing the ecological footprints of commodities via the Internet of Things, with sensors recording the environmental impacts of manufacturing processes.

3. Empowering unbanked communities to receive direct payments in bitcoin for ecosystem services or for meeting conservation targets.

4. Enabling better policy making via blockchain voting and decentralized sharing economies.

Chapron argues that smart contracts could manage natural resources. “For example, a quota for extracting natural resources could be issued to a community only after remote sensing data have proved that the community has met conservation targets,” he says.

Science, another prestigious journal – Science and Nature are often considered as the top two scientific journals – has published an interview with Chapron.

“The environmental crisis grows in a fertile ground, which is the multiplication of intermediaries,” says Chapron. For example, “if you buy a fish at the supermarket, the supply chain is very long. The supermarket might not even know where it came from. And so, there are multiple opportunities for environmentally unsustainable goods to enter the supply chain.” Using blockchain technology for supply chain management would permit the supermarket – and the consumer – to quickly and easily trace each and every step.

Not that there aren’t important challenges that must be solved for blockchain technology to realize its full potential for environmental issues. According to Chapron, the very limited throughput of current blockchain technologies is an important concern, and better scaling solutions are needed. “And then the big irony is that the blockchain is a giant sucker of energy,” notes Chapron. “What’s needed is to develop a more energy-efficient algorithm.”

“When people understand more and more what the blockchain will allow, they will have more and more new ideas that we can’t imagine today,” concludes Chapron. “My paper is intended to stimulate thinking.

False,Anyone familiar with California WaterFix?,"I'd be curious to hear some thoughts about [California WaterFix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Water_Fix_and_Eco_Restore) (and by extension the Twin Tunnel project), whether you support or oppose it, and importantly what should be done instead. 

For those not familiar, WaterFix is a project aiming to overhaul the water conveyance system in the state from the San Joaquin-Sacramento Delta to south of the state, given rising demands for irrigation water and urban consumption. Furthermore the state argues that *it needs* to act to remedy the Delta's current state of ecological crisis, and that the current conveyance system is unfit for the state's future usage (citing increase salinity from rising sea levels, old levees vulnerable to seismic activity, the over-reliance of irrigation practices on underground water-tables etc.).

The project is universally opposed by conservation groups and various organizations in the Delta, who argue that the project's purpose is to divert water to buyers practicing unsustainable desert agriculture. Municipal water agencies aren't thrilled either, since they will have to foot part of the $15 billion bill for the next 50 years (even in years where they wouldn't be receiving water in cases of droughts). And the project faces bipartisan opposition in the CA legislature, prompting a potential ballot initiative if the project obtains the permits it requires from NEPA and CEPA.

From my perspective: I read parts of the [Environmental Impact Statement](http://baydeltaconservationplan.com/FinalEIREIS/2016DirectDownload.aspx) (a monster of a PDF doc) submitted earlier this year and I found something particularly interesting: the project proponent (the California Department of Water Resources) admits that the twin tunnel project will have a net negative impact on local Delta residents, in particular minorities and low-income populations, **despite** mitigation measures. However by NEPA and CEPA standards that would not prevent the project from moving on ahead.

As a long-time California resident, while I understand the need to retrofit the Delta' conveyance system, the Twin Tunnel project is just bizarre. I'd be interested if anyone has an argument to justify how diverting Delta's freshwater helps restore the area's ecosystem, or how it resolves statewide water shortages. There is also a lack of emphasis on sustainable usage and consumption; the name of the game seems to be ""we must keep over-producing (read: irrigating) despite shortages and an unpredictable climatic regime"".

False,Vegetarianism and the Global Environment,"In most cases when someone is trying to argue or convince someone to understand their point of view when it comes to eating meat, they take the stance that it is cruel to the animals that are being killed and in a lot of cases that is true in terms of their production, but that argument didn’t work for me. I don't know if its because I'm heartless or desensitized to the point of not caring about the animals well being, but I was never swayed by that point of view. I know that the mistreatment of animals who are produced in large quantities suffer unneeded amounts, but that wasn’t a fact that moved me to make a change. It wasn't until I learned about how intensive animal farming or industrial livestock production affected the Earth in regards to global climate change that I reflected on my habits and how they effect the world around me. I think the idea that myself, someone I knew, my future children, or in general the planet that my species calls home could be put in jeopardy made me think. In this post I am going to discuss the facts that drove me to become a vegetarian and that I would hope would convince someone else to become one as well, or at least reduce the amount of meat they consume. I will use as many trusted sources as I can to provide information that I find to be very important for people to know and to reflect on. In a time where the validity of information is consistently being scrutinized, it is important that the information we spread is reliable.
	
Along with this idea of convincing people to become a vegetarian or at least eat less meat, which is a hard goal in itself, is to convince people that climate change exists and that it is propagated through human actions. For the sake of this post, I am not going to try to convince anyone that climate change is real or not because that would be a large conversation in itself. I am going to assume that anyone who reads any further has a similar mindset as myself when I first discovered this information about global climate change or maybe someone who has an open enough mind to read these this statistics and look into the problem themselves. The first thing that got to me when learning about the affects of meat consumption on the environment was my lack of understanding exactly how everything comes together to form what we know as climate change. I knew that CO2 was a major contributor that everyone focuses on and that methane, nitrous oxide and other gases played a part as well, but I did not know the extent in which agriculture and meat production play into every part that increase global climate change.
	
More often than not when people talk about climate change and its inputs, they are usually measuring the amount of CO2 which gives a somewhat distorted picture of what the true “foot print” is for any given producer of a green house gas. The other gas that needs to be given more attention is methane gas. Methane gas is not always heard about, more than likely because it accounts for a smaller portion of the total emissions and stays in the atmosphere for far less time, but it actually has a warming effect that is higher than that of CO2. While CO2 accounts for around 82 percent of human emissions and remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, methane accounts for what would seem to be a measly 11 percent. But methane has a global warming potential that is 28 to 36 times stronger than that of CO2, but only stays in the atmosphere for around a decade. These numbers show that methane is just as much of a contributor as CO2, but the real problem is the source that creates all of the methane.
	
Over the last 150 years methane levels have doubled as a result of human activities such as fossil fuel industry drilling for methane gas, as well as intensive agricultural farming practices and growing livestock. While the fossil fuel industry is still the leading producer of methane emissions at 33 percent, livestock and farming make up 27 percent and are aimed to increase in the future. While the amount of CO2 omitted and the need for methane gas for power could potentially decrease over time as a result of better technologies or the eventual peak oil crisis, methane from agriculture and livestock is different. The growth of the livestock industry will coincide with the growth of the human population that is estimated to be around 35 percent between 2006 and 2050. The more the population grows exponentially, exponentially more meat will need to be grown to feed those people, and the more meat needed to feed the population, more land will be repurposed to grow the feed required. This will decrease the amount of carbon sinks available to trap CO2 and keep it from being released into the atmosphere and further add to the problem.
	
Not only does eating a highly meat intense diet contribute to global climate change, but it also comes with a set of global environmental challenges that only become worse if the problem is not confronted. With the rate of population growth that we are currently following there could be upwards of 9 billion people on the planet by the year 2050. This would require an increase in agricultural space for production up to two times than we are currently producing, which would lead to increased loss of ecosystems around the world, including the rainforests that are home to some of the worlds most diverse wild life, as well as one of the largest carbon sinks. The increase in agricultural production would also require more water to the degree that it would be unsustainable and in some cases impractical with the agricultural sector already consuming a staggering 70 percent of the fresh water that is available on the planet. This problem would become increasingly worse since 85 percent of the worlds population lives on the driest half of the planet and three quarters of a billion people don't have access to clean water. The people who live in the drier areas would have no way to grow the amounts of agriculture needed to sustain their local populations and their need for protein rich meats, leading them to rely on other countries who would also be struggling pushing their production to the limits. The water use would increase the amount of chemical runoff from agricultural fields which would in turn contribute to low oxygen rich water, further reducing ocean biodiversity and affecting other kinds of business such as fishing that are important for feeding the world as well as some poorer communities that rely on fish as their main source of food. In terms of water, a shift from a meat heavy diet to a more plant based diet would reduce the amount of water needed to produce food, potentially helping eliminated or diminish the current world food and water crisis.
	
Per person the USDA advises that a healthy diet of meat should consist of about 125 pounds of beef per year. Of the 196 countries on Earth, there are 60 countries that eat more than the recommended amount. The amount of calories that are consumed by people directly through agriculture is only 55 percent while 36 percent is fed to livestock that is then fed to humans at a later time. If those countries that consume more than the recommended amount reduced their meat consumption, to the even the average amount by the year 2050, there is a chance that it could make an impact on the processes that we have to feed our local and global communities. It is obvious when confronted with the numbers and statistics that eating meat at the rate in which we do is unsustainable and a change must be made. Meat does not have to be completely cut out immediately, if at all, but there needs to be a dietary shift away from the consumption of highly inefficient meats. We could feed the world if the crops that we grew in our fields were intended to be eaten by people instead of an insane number of people, who are increasing in numbers exponentially. 
	
I am constantly learning new things in life and am always open to new things and becoming a vegetarian is something that I never thought I would adopt as a way of life. I truly love meat and I miss it all the time, but the world is bigger than my selfish desires. The world is constantly growing and so should our perceptions of it. There are so many things today that need to be changed and we are the ones who can make a difference, and this is a small step towards something great. I hope that the data I shared can change a few minds or open up some to a different way of living.

False,Things we can do on an individual level.,"Is there a way we can either sticky or post on the sidebar a list of the things we can do as individuals to help the environment and work against climate change? I know there are lists online - some great and some useless - but seeing as how this is a subreddit specifically about the environment I think it would be a great resource to let everyone know how they can easily and practically help. From something as simple as lifestyle changes or instructions on how to effectively engage a community of people to either raise money or host clean-up days etc. 

It would also be great if this list could include organizations that are somehow ranked by their effectiveness in conservation. For instance, a lot of people will immediately think of Greenpeace, but they hardly - if ever- acknowledge the devastating impact that animal agriculture has on our environment and push for sustainable fishing when there isn't really such a thing at this point in time. These claims never seem to account for the fact the majority of seafood is imported and therefore needs to be transported to places in demand - unless people plan on luring their own fish for meals. The Sierra Club at least acknowledges that we should be vastly minimizing our meat intake, but then goes on to say that when we do eat meat it should be grass-fed and local - which although more humane, has been proven to be more damaging to the environment than conventional practices. Another peeve is conservation groups that greenwash the use of sustainable palm oil. 

I already do as much as I know how to, but there's always room for improvement. Day after day, depressing news about climate change increases and optimistic stories are fewer and farther between. I need new ideas rather than change your light bulbs and use reusable bags. What do you do on an individual level and how do you think we can increase our effectiveness?

False,"Counterintuitive, but important point about trophy hunting","I spent my past summer in Botswana on an environmental science research program. Trophy hunting was a pretty huge topic. As someone who does care a lot about lions and other endangered wildlife populations, I feel the need to share this very important, but counterintuitive point about trophy hunting in Africa.

In 2014, Botswana outlawed game hunting due to the controversy it stirred and the calls to boycott Botswana tourism by international conservationist organizations. Many of the game reserves in Botswana could not be sustained simply by safaris and photographic tourism. Without game hunting, villages whose entire economy was based on the revenue it received from game hunting had to find a new way to earn revenue. Additionally, these villages depended on game hunting for food as well. As with much of rural Africa, most of these people turned to agriculture/livestock (mostly livestock) for their new source of income. The lions and other animals which threatened the production of livestock were killed, and the game reserves were converted into grazing land for the livestock. This ended up killing just about all of the wildlife in these areas either directly or indirectly through livestock squandering the food supply. This also exacerbated the issue of over-grazing/desertification in rural Botswana. The rural land of Botswana which once had a diverse collection of plants and animals, is now littered with homogenous thorny bushes (they thrive without the competition of grass, which is consumed by the livestock), cattle dung, cattle, and some donkeys and sickly stray dogs.

It is also important to remember game hunting was regulated. There was a quota system. Permits to hunt lions (and other animals) were auctioned off and they contained various stipulations. These permits could be sold for over $50,000, which provided a huge amount of support to local communities. Local communities were also often given permits to hunt say one single elephant a year, which could provide enough food to feed the village year round. The quotas were based off of the analysis of experts to control animal populations. It may sound ridiculous, but in many ways, Botswana's wildlife populations benefited from game hunting. For example, despite illegal poaching causing a global decline in elephant populations, there are places in Botswana that have too many Elephants, and this disrupts the balance of the ecosystem. This balance could be restored through reduction of the elephant population.

This is not to say there were not problems lions faced from game hunting. One of the stipulations of a male lion permit was that they had to be over 2 years old, after they had done their evolutionary duty (get lady lion pregnant). However, it was impractical for hunters to be able to determine the age of a lion before killing it. This caused an imbalance in the male-female lion ratio in some areas. Nonetheless, it is very clear that wildlife populations are much worse off without the game hunting industry.

Personally, I would never hunt a lion. I don't believe that rich dentists who pay $50,000 to kill a lion have charitable motives. They want a lion head over their fireplace so they show their friends how macho they are, as they drink whisky and laugh about how rich they are. However, I urge you to push your emotions aside when this topic comes up. I haven't looked into it, but I'm sure that the dentist who was publicly shamed this summer for killing Cecil the Lion caused a decrease in African game hunting, which would have in effect hurt Africa's lions. So if you really care about lions in Africa, and/or the environment or economy of Africa, I urge you not to support any limitations on game hunting. If it is regulated through an expert-designed quota system, as it was in Botswana, I guarantee you, publicly shaming the hunters or supporting legislation to ban or limit the industry will do more bad than good.",Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability,Fear (Negative)

That approach to regeneration has been mostly a failure. So roll your sleeves up, it’s time to regenerate the Satoyama Economy by reintegrating it back into our present day economy. Through reintegration we will enhance resiliency, establish a new commons, create new business models, and spawn uber-symbiosis. But no more talking about how cool it can be and how important it is, let’s do this shit already !

**proAction**

I read the [Satoyama Initiative](http://satoyama-initiative.org/) and poured through their video archives, but I don’t see what they’re physically doing in Japan. It’s very scientific; there are scores of meeting pictures; for years they’ve been organizing and re-organizing old knowledge; and at present they’ve got 155 member groups who they deal with directly…

This has probably been a huge initiative in Japan, yet where’s the tangible change here? At this point I want to yell out loud “*The only thing that can make tangible change is a more tactical idea! And the Idea has to be all-encompassing, one that drags everyone in to meaningful change.*”

The idea must call for a system of everyone fighting to share in the benefits of a massively wealthy expanding Satoyama Economy, something that is entirely in the interests of the people who are organizing. So how can you create this in a place like Japan where the majority aren’t in a position to profit from it yet?

Offer something great !

**Prudence**

Take a step back and look at the great successes of the golden age of organizing. Mostly it was categories of people, formerly excluded, fighting to share in the benefits of a massively wealthy expanding economy. This was simple to understand, it was entirely in the interests of the people who were organizing, and it was something that more powerful people could afford to give up.

The kinds of things that we are organizing for now are not so easy: to “save” the satoyama landscape, to STOP climate change, to stop the extraction of resources on which our own comfort depends, to get a bigger share of a shrinking economy.

But look at all the tactically effective organizing to take care of our needs outside the system: spirituality, family, community supported agriculture, farmers’ markets, rainwater harvesting, backyard gardens, chicken coops an so on and so forth. Of course we still have a long way to go, but this is where the action is, not on the streets but in tribal circles doing tangible change where you are.

So the next question is how can the tribes organize the masses to regenerate the Satoyama Economy? The two biggest hurdles to this shift in Japan is that 1. the majority aren’t in a position to profit from it, and 2. the power holders here don’t see a way to profit from it either. For the answer, let’s go back to the golden age of organizing. The tribes must set up a system in which everyone else is fighting to share in the benefits of a massively wealthy expanding Satoyama Economy, something that is entirely in the interests of the people who are organizing. I see two tactical approaches to this: Harnessing higher education as agents for change and utilizing money(power) for them to employ in a new expanding economy.

**Investigation**

Certainly, our students can “take us back” to chiefly a Satoyama Economy if we want them to, but most of us will have the desire and the ability to integrate what we’ve learned over the last few decades into the world to come. If our ancestors could integrate [swords and surgical blades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3at1K-SzCk) {video}, can our students integrate hydro-electric and mountain herbs and convenience stores? How about green tea and chop sticks and hot tap water and Google? The problem, right now, is that so many of the things we like about Japan are tied to things that cannot or must not continue — consumption of non-renewable resources, extermination of the biosphere, and a million jobs that nobody would do if they weren’t forced.

To regenerate the Satoyama Economy, we must first reflect on how we are doing it at present. The Satoyama Economy is a Japanese traditional and beautiful agricultural system – a mosaic of people, mixed forests, rice paddy fields, dry rice fields, grasslands, streams, ponds, and reservoirs for irrigation. But it’s also an economy that is now on the verge of extinction, resulting in the hollowing-out of entire satoyama communities, and because the majority of small satoyama farms in Japan are fragmented with owners unwilling to sell, a patchwork of satoyama has proven difficult to consolidate by many stakeholders and beneficiaries, including local communities, both national and local government agencies, and research and academic institutions.

So far establishment has said that restoration and conservation requires collective action from all sectors and stakeholders, but, again, as seen below in [UNU-IAS](http://www.ias.unu.edu/sub_page.aspx?catID=130&ddlID=475) this approach has been mostly a failure:

>According to Norimasa Toga of the Nature Conservation Division of Environment and Safety Affairs Department at the Ishikawa Prefectural Government, Ishikawa Prefectural Government has been implementing cooperative projects to sustainably mobilise and utilise the scarce resources of each stakeholder and raise awareness on common issues affecting satoyama at the prefectural level. Besides the satoyama conservation and restoration agreement, other cooperative projects in the Prefecture include the joint management of nature schools which involves administrative organisations, NPOs, educational institutions, and local business enterprises. However, **problems such as the vertical administrative system found in Japan, jurisdictional competition, and conflict of interests are inherent in the efforts by numerous stakeholders with different interests and mandates.** Cooperative actions require a fair and effective distribution or share of funds and benefits, and clarification and coordination of the roles among stakeholders. This is something which local and national governments need to consider by providing the framework for operation.

In other words, the decentralized approach to “saving” the Satoyama Economy doesn’t work in Japan because there’s too much baggage and, besides, although not mentioned above, there’s almost zero economic incentive for all parties involved! So what I suggest is that in the beginning, at least, it needs to be centrally run and operated with holistic economic domination ! And it needs to be approached in a way that we are regenerating through reintegration back into our present day economy, not merely “saving” something. So, dear reader, what we need is effective implementation of projects, financial resources, sufficient technology, and human resources on both the stakeholder and beneficiary sides…

But 1. What projects do we make? 2. Who is going to pay for this? 3. How can it work? and 4. Who is going to do this?

**Tactic**

I propose the idea of a nation-wide university student led organization via an online internet platform, or social networking site, that is an NPO. This NPO can be involved in preparation, delivery, and follow-up of student led programs* (see below) that are implemented alongside community members and local technicians. Online, students can organize each other as well as collaborate with specific locations and groups they intend to engage with in the field. Students can also reach out to donors or stakeholders who are interested in the new economy.

The students can make projects at their respective campuses as well as inter-campus via the online NPO, then connect with their beneficiaries in the field to either hone or broaden program missions, and come up with ways the stakeholders and beneficiaries both can financially benefit. Eventually the campus-to-campus organization and program missions can be integrated into the university curriculum, and students can receive credit towards their degrees for participating in on-going projects in the field. The ultimate mission for all this being the implementation of sustainable Satoyama Economic Regeneration departments countrywide…

With jobs waiting for students in the field. GO !

Programs could include Agriculture, Architecture, Business, Energy, Environmental, Forestry, Restoration, Transportation, etc.

False,Conventional vs Organic Farming,"I am a conventional farmer in Western Canada (growing wheat, canola, malt barley and oats), and am also a professional engineer (mechanical).  

A couple of months ago, I stumbled across one of my old engineering professor's Twitter accounts and saw him bashing conventional agriculture and promoting organic.  I put together some information for him to challenge his views and make him realize that the issues are not as ""cut and dried"" as he was making them out to be.  I have since shared it with a few other people, and have been encouraged to publish it online.

So, here it goes...


**A bit of background on me....**

I grew up on a family farm in Western Canada.  I studied Mechanical Engineering and graduated with my Bachelor's in 2008.  I had the top marks in my class, and received the Gold Medal in Mechanical Engineering.  I continued at the same university for two more years and completed a thesis-based Master's degree. 

Upon graduating, I worked for a small bio-energy firm  for three years and earned my P.Eng.  After finishing my P.Eng, I made the decision to leave my full time job so I could be more involved with the farm (while I enjoy engineering, the farm has always been my passion).  I continue to practice as an engineer during off-peak times on the farm with a small company that specializes in doing energy audits.

Together with my brother (who has a BSc in Agriculture (Crop Sciences)), my dad, and one full-time employee, we farm approximately 5,250 acres of farmland (roughly 8.2 square miles, or 21.2 square kilometers).  We generally grow wheat, canola, oats and malt barley, all for human consumption (not animal feed).  In a typical year, our farm produces around 8,000 Metric Tonnes of grain (imagine how many people that feeds!).

We employ a wide variety of advanced farming techniques, including zero-tillage farming, GPS auto-steer and sectional control (to avoid over-application of fertilizer and pesticides), GPS yield mapping, variable rate fertilizer applications (to target fertilizer to the areas of the field with high yield potential), and are even experimenting with the use of UAV drones for data collection.

I'm not sure what your views/experience with agriculture are, but I thought I would share some of my views on various topics that seem to come up from individuals that have concerns with modern agriculture.

**Sustainability**

One point that I often see raised is sustainability - many people feel that organic farming is more sustainable than conventional farming.  A couple points I would like to raise on this:

- Does yield factor into your definition of sustainability?  Yields in conventional agriculture are significantly higher than yields in organic farming. A meta-analysis of organic and conventional farming found that yields from organic agriculture are often as much as 34% lower than from conventional agriculture. (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature11069.html?message-global=remove)

When less food is produced from each acre of land, then more land must be brought into production.  The bio-fuels industry received a lot of criticism for causing deforestation of the Brazilian rainforests because so much corn was being used to make ethanol.  Organic farming (which produces less per acre, thus requiring more land) is just as responsible for this.

- Another factor that is often overlooked is nutrients.  One of the biggest environmental impacts of conventional agriculture is the large amounts of energy required to produce synthetic fertilizers.  However, organic farmers are reliant on conventional farmers in this area...

Determining how much fertilizer is required for a crop is a fairly simple mass balance.  The grain we harvest each year contains nutrients.  Thus, each year we must apply enough fertilizer to offset the nutrients we are removing in the grain.  We monitor this over time by having soil from each of our fields tested by a lab every year to ensure that nutrient levels are being maintained.

Organic farmers face this same challenge.  However, organic farming does not allow for the use of synthetic fertilizer.  While crop rotations can be used to satisfy some of their nutrient requirements (crops like peas and beans have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in their roots and take nitrogen from the air and make it available to the plant - and note, conventional farmers utilize this too!), they often apply manure as fertilizer.  That manure is often from animals that have been eating conventional grain (so the nutrients in the manure are from synthetic fertilizer).  A study done in [France](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/4/044045/article) found that 23% of the Nitrogen, 73% of the Phosphorous, and 53% of the Potassium nutrients (the 3 main macro-nutrients) used in organic farming were from synthetic fertilizer.  So in reality, the only difference is that the nutrients that organic farmers use have gone through the digestive tract of a cow ;)

- The last sustainability topic that I want to bring up is tillage.  Over the past 20 years, nearly every acre of grain farmland in Western Canada has been converted to zero-tillage farming.  Each spring, the new crop is seeded directly into the stubble from the previous year's crop with the smallest amount of soil disturbance possible.  This practice has drastically reduced soil erosion, it helps conserve moisture, and it sequesters carbon in the soil (in fact, farmers who adopt this practice in Alberta generate Carbon Offset credits).

I grew up in the 80's, when tillage was still the norm.  To seed our crops, we used to have to make anywhere from 3 to 8 passes over our fields.  The result was soil that was completely pulverized, bone dry, and susceptible to wind erosion.

Nearly all the fence lines in Western Canada have dirt ""drifts"" along them, from soil erosion.  My parents have pictures of me and my sister playing outside when we were young on black snow, since wind had blown soil from nearby fields into our yard.  After a windy day, rural counties used to have to send crews out to dig the soil of of the ditches along the county roads and dump it back on the farmer's fields.

Why do I bring this up?  Organic farmers are utilizing tillage to control weeds.  Still sound more sustainable than conventional farming?

**Pesticides**

Another point that I often see raised is pesticides - here are some thoughts on that...

- First of all, organic farmers use them too.  While they are not allowed to use synthetic pesticides, they are allowed to use naturally occurring ones.  However, as I'm sure you realize, not everything found in nature is ""safe"" or ""less toxic"" than synthetically made things.  Many of the ""natural"" pesticides used in organic farming are more toxic than the synthetic ones used in conventional farming.

[Here](https://twitter.com/DavidKucher/status/602649450310275073/photo/1) is a list of pesticides allowed in organic farming. 

- Newer, safer pesticides are constantly being developed.  Of the three classes of pesticides (herbicides, which control weeds; fungicides, which control plant diseases; and insecticides, which control insects), insecticides are the most dangerous.  We are fortunate in Western Canada that our cold climate does a good job of controlling insects, so we very rarely have to use them.  However, sometimes insect infestations happen and they do need to be used.

One of the major downsides of using an insecticide is that they are non-selective, meaning that they kill ALL insects in the fields (including beneficial insects that feed on the pest insects, and pollinators like bees).  As a result, farmers take the decision to use an insecticide very seriously!

Dupont has recently developed a new insecticide called [Coragen](http://www.dupont.ca/content/dam/assets/industries/agriculture/assets/cp_PSD-67_Coragen_Tech_Bulletin_Canola_E.pdf) which helps address this issue.  Rather than killing insects on contact by attacking their nervous system, the insecticide coats the plants.  When insects eat the plant, the chemical paralyzes their jaws, causing them to starve.  The insecticide has no impact on bees and other beneficial insects.

Rather than being able to embrace new products like this, organic farmers will have to continue using the highly toxic ""natural"" insecticides that they are permitted to use (such as pyrethrin - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrethrin)

- Using the least amount of pesticides possible is the goal of all farmers - they are very expensive! (and we are the ones exposed to them in their most concentrated form - using less of them reduces our exposure to them).

All farmers (conventional and organic) practice Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Throughout the year, a wide variety of measures are taken to control pests, with pesticides being only one of them.

Some examples of IPM would include: establishing a healthy plant stand (through proper seeding rates) to enable the plants to out-compete pests, selecting varieties that are resistant to pests (and rotating varieties, to ensure that resistance does not break down), utilizing crop rotations (certain pests target certain crops), and eliminating areas where insects/weeds live/breed (ex: mowing weeds in ditches/abandoned yardsites to prevent them from going to seed). When a pesticide is used, the field is first scouted to verify that it is in fact necessary, the pesticide is applied at the correct rate and at the correct time, and the pesticides used are rotated from year to year to avoid developing resistance).

**GMO's**

Another topic that draws a lot of attention is genetically modified crops (such as in the March Against Monsanto this past weekend).  A few points on them...

- The scientific consensus is that GMO's are safe.  The Pew Research Center polled the membership of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and found that 88% of scientists feel it is safe to eat genetically modified food (which is greater than the 87% consensus that humans are causing climate change).  In contrast, only 37% of the general public feels that GMO's are safe.  This is the largest gap in opinion between scientists and the general public.

- There is more to GMO's than Monsanto.  For example, GMO's saved the Hawaiian papaya industry by developing a variety that was resistant to a disease that nearly wiped out that industry; GMO's are being used to develop orange trees that are resistant to a disease that is threatening the Florida orange industry; GMO's have been used to develop bio-fortified crops, such as Golden Rice; etc.

- GMO's are helping farmers to reduce the use of pesticides.  Bt crops have cut down on the amount of insecticides by making the crops naturally resistant to insect attacks.  Round-up Ready crops (resistant to the herbicide glyphosate) have increased the use of glyphosate; however, glyphosate is less toxic than the herbicides that it has replaced (ie: the herbicides used to control weeds in non-GMO crops).

On our own farm, we grow GMO canola.  The other crops we grow (wheat, oats, and malt barley) are all non-GMO (no GMO varieties are registered for use).  In the past 20 years, our canola yields have doubled (from approximately 25 bushels/acre to 50 bushels per acre), while the amount of herbicides (and their toxicity) we use have decreased.

Yields of our other (non-GMO) crops have increased too, but at a much, much slower rate (in the same period of time, wheat yields would have gone from around 50 bushels/acre to 60 bushels/acre, a 20% increase).

**Monsanto**

A lot of the public's disdain for modern agriculture is directed at Monsanto.  Here are some points on that...

- Growing GMO crops requires farmers to enter into a contract with the company that developed the seed (Monsanto, Bayer, etc - Monsanto is not the only company that makes GMO's).  Farmers are free to choose whether or not to do this (if they don't want to, they can grow non-GMO crops).  However, many farmers do choose to grow them, because the increased yields and other benefits they offer outweigh the additional costs.

One of the terms of the contract is that the farmers must purchase new seed every year.  Farmers often do this regardless of whether they are growing GMO or non-patented non-GMO crops.  Crops bred through hybridization (corn, canola, etc) only exhibit the increased plant vigor they offer for one generation, so new seed must be used each year.  For crops that don't use hybrid breeding (wheat, oats, barley, etc), breeders are constantly releasing new varieties with improved traits (higher yields, disease resistance, etc), so farmers often purchase new seed regularly to take advantage of this.

- Monsanto has never sued farmers for accidental contamination of their crops. (http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/gm-seed-accidentally-in-farmers-fields.aspx).  

They do sue farmers who breach their contract with Monsanto and save seed and replant it without paying royalties - rightly so though! Monsanto spends roughly $1 billion per year on research and development - they need to make a return on that investment.  In addition to that, if they were to allow some farmers to break the rules and not pay royalties, then it puts the farmers who do play by the rules at a disadvantage (since they have higher costs than their neighbors who are not paying the royalty).

- Monsanto is primarily a seed business, not a pesticide manufacturer.  Round-Up (glyphosate) is the only pesticide they manufacture, and it has been off-patent for a number of years.  The majority of the glyphosate used is ""generic"" (ie: made by other companies).

- Organic food is big business too.  Whole Foods (an organic supermarket chain) has yearly sales that are approximately equal to Monsanto's.

**General Comments**

A few random comments...

- ""Corporate"" farms are not big, ""evil"" companies.  My family's farm is a ""corporate"" farm (ie: it is ""incorporated"").  Many family farms do this for tax purposes.  Our farming business pays each of use a wage to live on, and the rest of the farm's profits stay in the farm and are re-invested (in land, machinery, etc).

- Like all things in life, agriculture involves ""balancing"" many competing objectives/goals. Farming requires balancing environmental conservation with the need to feed a growing population (with less labor, since trends are towards increased urbanization) at a reasonable cost (even in ""first world"" countries like Canada there are people who cannot afford to eat proper meals!).

- To me, it is important for farmers to produce food  in the most efficient way possible.  If someone is a small market gardener on the outskirts a city, and they have enough labor to grow everything ""organically"" and feel that those practices make them most efficient, then great! They should absolutely do that! However, suggesting that ALL farming should be organic, when nothing suggests that this is even possible, is a terrible attitude (and one that is only possible for very privileged, first-world urbanites).

- While some ""organic"" farming practices do have merit (as I discussed, there are lots that conventional farmers use too!), organic farming as a whole is too much about conforming to an arbitrary set of ""rules"", rather than doing what is best/most efficient.  Technology is going to continue to develop, and organic farmers are not going to be able to embrace many new things coming down the pipeline (GMO crops bred to be more nutrient/water efficient, insecticides like the one I mentioned that only target pest insects, etc).

- Technology has improved every aspect of our lives - why wouldn't we apply it to farming?  I often wonder if when the ""pro-organic"" people go to the doctor's office if they ask to be treated using technology from 70 years ago?  If not, then why do they do that when they buy food???

- Lastly, I'm going to share a TED talk on agriculture with you.  It was done by an agrologist from Alberta.  I feel it does an excellent job articulating the challenges affecting modern agriculture.  Of all the links I have shared in this email, this is the one I would most encourage you to check out :)

False,"Unsustainability, Consumption, and What It Means to Be Human","Achieving sustainability is one of the greatest challenges that humanity has ever faced and will become a main focus during the twenty-first century. In the past hundred years humanity has made innumerable accomplishments that have made the world a better place, but at the same time we have also seen a degradation of the natural systems that support life due to an increase in irresponsible human activities. By driving our cars and powering our cities we pollute our air, through industrial agriculture we degrade the soil that grows our food, through excessive consumption we cut down the forests that clean our water and we overfish our seas, and the list goes on. Earnest Callenbach, author of Ecology: A Pocket Guide, defines a sustainable society as “one that satisfies its needs without diminishing the prospects of future generations.” In today’s modern society we have an array of cultural habits we use to solve problems, but many of these habits unfortunately do not generate the desired outcomes we seek, and can sometimes lead to self-destructiveness. If we hope to continue to thrive into the future it is essential that we learn to fulfill our human aspirations in ways that will lead to genuine satisfaction, and still provide future generations the ability to meet their basic needs and aspirations.

In today’s modern postindustrial society we have seen great strides in providing the masses with the ability to meet their needs and desires through an increase in accessibility to resources. After World War II, many corporations were fearing that the demand for production would decrease and they would reach overproduction (BBC). The solution that has become the norm in our economic culture was well articulated by the retail analyst, Victor Lebow, “Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction and our ego satisfaction in consumption. We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.” This has disaffected the people in modern society by emphasizing the importance of having, and leads us to seek our sense of meaning and fulfillment through consumption.

Through this mode of thinking we have prevented ourselves from flourishing in nearly every sense of the word, and through our hunger to acquire more we have forgotten that there is more to life than having things. Humanist philosopher and social psychologist, Erich Fromm, wrote that, “Human beings had two basic orientations: HAVING and BEING. HAVING: seeks to acquire, possess things even people. BEING: focuses on the experience; exchanging, engaging, sharing with other people.” Today we live in a society where the dominant cultural paradigm (consumerism) is dominated by the having orientation, and Fromm believed that people who lived with such an orientation ultimately feel a sense of emptiness and dissatisfaction.

In Dr. John Ehrenfeld’s book, Sustainability by Design: A Subversive Strategy for Transforming Our Consumer Culture, he discusses how immersion in this cultural paradigm has disaffected humans in three critical domains. He writes, “Flourishing can occur only if we pay close attention to the three critical domains that the forces of modernity have dimmed: Our sense of ourselves as human beings: the human domain. Our sense of our place in the [natural] world: the natural domain. Our sense of doing the right thing: the ethical domain,” (Ehrenfeld 58). Wasteful and unsatisfying consumption, breakdowns in personal and familial relationships, litigiousness, degradation of the environment, and what most people understand as banality and shallowness result from a lack of consciousness in any of the three domains (Ehrenfeld).

Currently, the environment has been most affected by our lack of awareness in these domains. In order to satisfy a desire to have and acquire more we cut down forests for land and resources, over-consume our water resources for nonessentials, reduce biodiversity and farmland through industrial agriculture and human development, produce considerable amounts of toxic waste and products through industrial manufacturing, and so on. Clearly, with just over 7 billion people on the planet, and a growing middle class, consumption will only increase. This though, is harmful to our species as it negatively affects vital ecosystem services that humanity and almost every other species on the planet depends on. According to the National Wildlife Federation, “An ecosystem service is any positive benefit that wildlife or ecosystems provides to people.” These include provisions like potable water, oxygen and clean air, food, medicine, and recourses such as wood and fibers. Other examples include crop pollination, decomposition and nutrient recycling, erosion and flood control, carbon sequestration, and climate regulation (National Wildlife Federation). Through our desire to grow and acquire more material goods, we have put added stresses on the environment to the point that we are degrading these important services, and threatening our species’ future.

Another source of our unsustainability comes from modern culture’s tendency to believe that technology can solve all of our problems, even when technology is the source of a problem. When faced with the issue of unsustainability our society tends to prefer the technological solution. Ehrenfeld describes our way of acting in his writing, “In our modern way of thinking and acting, we are accustomed to solving virtually every problem by some sort of technological means. By this I mean not only using some favorite artifactual device, but also by applying ‘scientific’ theories when all of the alternative means held in reserve also fail to work. Although solutions to the immediate problem may appear, this habitual way of acting has the insidious ‘side effect’ of producing serious deterioration of nature and our own humanistic capabilities. The long run of success of the technological fix has also led to unjustified expectations that such solutions can always be found,” (17-18). For example, this is true when considering the methods in which we try to address the problem of fossil fuel consumption by cars. We try to mitigate the problem by switching all cars to electric, but we fail to also address the fact that for every ton of car thirteen tons of toxic waste is produced . It should be evident that the fundamental solution to solve the issues created by technology is to reduce the need of certain technologies, especially those with a superfluous purpose.

To understand what motivates us to take certain courses of actions it is essential to breakdown the reasons behind such actions. In one of Aristotle’s better-known writings, he attempted to understand the way in which humans give meaning to manmade objects into four separate categories of cause. The first two causes were concerned with the object’s material and form, the third cause (efficient cause) was concerned with the process which conceived the object, and the fourth cause (final cause) was concerned with the meaningful purpose or end the object was created to fulfill (Aristotle). Ehrenfeld explained the relevance of Aristotle’s writings by writing, “Our present mentality exposes only his ‘efficient cause,’ that is, the one that connects a surface phenomenon (effect) to its proximate cause. Such causes are the essence of the reductionism of modern science and are the basis for the dominant forms of modern technology. In Aristotle’s terms, the causes related to sustainability may have more to do with the ‘final cause,’ that is, the end toward which one acts or uses some form of technological artifact,” (Ehrenfeld 61). So basically, many technologies that do lead to our unsustainability are not necessary to fulfill the many of the ends we may seek.

In order to reclaim a sense of genuine satisfaction in our lives; restore our sense of humanity, ethical responsibility, and place in the world; and environmental health; and understand what we really long for in our lives we must once more begin to embrace the orientation of being. Rabbi Micheal Lerner describes the key to this transformation in orientation in his book, The Left Hand of God, and says that we must, “Recognize that people hunger for a world that has meaning and love; for a sense of aliveness, energy, and authenticity; for a life embedded in a community in which they are valued for who they most deeply are, with all their warts and limitations, and feel genuinely seen and recognized; and for a life that is about something more than just money and accumulating material goods,” (Lerner). When Ehrenfeld gave his definition of sustainability as, “the possibility that human and other life will flourish on the planet forever,” (Ehrenfeld 6), he referenced Lerner’s quote in order to give a clear idea of what he meant by flourishing. He insisted that in order to escape the self-destructive patterns of behavior that lead to our unsustainability that it was essential to recognize this basic human desire, and that there are other ways to satisfy this need than through material consumption.

Like addiction, unsustainability can be resolved through the same basic process. The first step to bring the change necessary to end unsustainability is to bring its self-destructive patterns into view and increase awareness. The second step is to replace the modern vision of having a technologically filled future, for a vision of a stable future where we can know that our ￼descendants will have an equal chance to appreciate and enjoy the world just as we did. The third step is to change the underpinnings of behavior that bring about unsustainability with new, more sustainable underlying systems of society and culture (Ehrenfeld 8). But for the purposes of transforming society towards sustainability, it is first necessary that people understand how and why we are currently living unsustainably.

In order to allow our society to embrace the cultural values of sustainability in the long run, it is essential to increase awareness of the effects of our behaviors through universal environmental education. In Ernest Callenbach’s book, Ecology: A Pocket Guide, he wrote about the nature of a society’s voluntary evolution and writes, “At some returning points history, dominant values become exhausted or problematic, and people work out new values that they hope will enable them to survive better. During the rise of consumer capitalism, Western peoples adopted the belief that technology can solve all our problems and is the most important thing in life; religious and cultural matters became secondary,” (148). Certain aspects of culture in many cases serve as evolutionary adaptations, which is evident when one analyzes the purpose of certain traditions and cultural habits. Examples of this include the spiritual significance that certain cultures place on the animals or their environment. But yes, culture may be one of the most powerful tools our society and our species can use to achieve the state of sustainability.

In today’s society the line between resource accessibility and resource availability has been blurred. Every time we go into a supermarket we are frequently given the impression that resources are abundant as we always see rows upon rows of products that never seem to run out. This has led us to behave irresponsibly in managing our resources, as this perspective allows for greater ease in consuming and disposing of objects. William Blake wrote in Proverbs of Hell, ￼“You never know what is enough, unless you know what is more than enough,” (6). This statement applies itself perfectly to the context of consumerism’s effects on the environment. Many people consume, replace, and dispose of the things they have without giving it a second thought, but this is unfortunately a result of people’s lack of ecological consciousness.

Universal environmental education will undoubtedly influence the worldview the students to the point of increasing the ability to identify the variety of ways in which humans depend on a healthy environment, and how humans impact environmental health. After enough generations have had a qualitative environmental education, then culture will naturally move towards embracing sustainable values. This education must be comprehensive though and must include knowledge subjects such as ecosystem services, biodiversity, ecology, survivalism, energy and resource management, permaculture, and human impacts. Each successive generation will have an exponential awareness of the environment as each proceeding generation will also be aware and promote more sustainable practices and values outside the classroom.

Many people may be skeptical of the need to change, as they don’t buy more than what they need. Although these people do reduce their impacts, many of the products bought and sold in the developed world are inherently unsustainable. Many mass produced products are saturated with embedded energy and resources; meaning, that they usually produce many times more waste than the weight of the product itself, and take enormous amounts of fossil fuels to move that product from resource extraction, to production, then to distribution. In a global economy like we have today, resources from all over the world are sent to very distant factories such as those in China, and then redistributed across the world, consuming enormous amounts of energy at each step.
Another argument is that the whole world can’t possibly be educated effectively. This fact has been well proven as the United Nations did fail to meet their goal of eliminating gender disparity in education, but the countries with the biggest impacts on the global environment are the more developed nations. They consume the most, emit the most pollutants, create the most waste, and also promote the values of consumerism. These are the countries with the resources to educate their public on the issues of their unsustainability.

Hopefully, humanity will move to embrace the characteristics of a sustainable culture so that we may have a comfortable future where we will be given the opportunity to thrive. Maybe it will be a world where we take time in life to appreciate its small pleasures, maybe it will be a world where we grow the food we need in our gardens and where we can harvest water in the desert, maybe humanity will be a species that protects and promotes life instead of destroying it, or a world where we chose to savor human connections above possessions. But most certainly, it will be a world where we are allowed to hope, and know that tomorrow will be just as good as today, if not better.

False,Have you been dealing with climate change nihilism? (X-post /r/climate),"Ever since I fell down the rabbit hole of climate change research, paleoclimate studies, methane releases, etc. I've felt a weight upon my life.
I get into these loops of catastrophic thinking where:

Arts and culture don't matter because civilization will be gone in 50 years or less

Social justice and human rights don't matter because no one will be kind to one another when we are fighting for food and clean water

Animal Conservation doesn't matter because any gains will be lost by drought and extreme heat

Deforestation doesn't matter because climate change (drought and heat) will finish off the trees even if we can grow more

Working hard doesn't matter because my life will be gone before 2050

Appreciating beauty doesn't matter because I'll just miss it once it is gone

Activism doesn't matter because the world is dependent on fossil fuels

Cutting emissions doesn't matter because methane will finish us off

Preparing for disaster and living rurally doesn't matter because climate change will change the world so much that I can't sustain myself in the tropics or subtropics

Living life for hedonistic pleasure doesn't matter because I can't get over life not mattering.

Loving and making friendships doesn't matter because it's all transitory

I'm young enough that I will live to see hell on earth, and the only solace I can take is that my parents and loved ones hopefully won't witness the worst.

The kicker is that there seems to be no solution. I want to go to college to learn sustainable agriculture but I won't have time to homestead before drought tears it all away. There's seems to be nothing to this knowledge than despair and pre traumatic stress. Any time I feel happiness I'm jolted back by remembering it only gets worse from here.

Do you feel the same way, have you found any way to live with it? 2030 and beyond seems like a horrible scary time.

False,Deforestation of the Amazon Rain forest,"My fellow Redditors, 
-As many of you may already know, one of the greatest environmental catastrophes in the making today is the destruction of the Amazon Rainforest. In the years from 1991 to 2000, humans cut down rose to 587,000 square kilometers, which is roughly equal to the area of Spain. Since 2006 the rainforest has already shrunk to almost only a third of its size, and is in a state of extreme peril. I’m presenting you with these numbers in order to instill a sense of urgency, because the situation truly is as grave as it may seem. 

--The main reasons for this deforestation are for common human needs. Human settlement, and land for cattle are the most commonly heard justification for the continuing removal of land that would normally serve as the home for wildlife. At the deforestation’s peak, there appeared to be great economic need for countries like Brazil to continue these expeditions, seeing as they are considered the world’s second largest producer of soybeans. Clearing these forests in order to make room for agriculture was described by the Brazilian legislation as an “effective use of land’. This made any contrary action extremely difficult.
-thankfully, as of 2004, Brazil’s own contribution to the deforestation of the Amazon has been reduced by about 80% because of pressure from satellite surveillance, law enforcement, and outraged environmentalists. This was a good occurrence, but was only made possible after 3/4 of the entire rainforest had already been cut down. In addition to this, the strict regulations were not matched by other countries, many of which began rising drastically in deforestation, when Brazil calmed their bad habit.
-Things have not been looking good in recent years. According to a study done by the Earth System Science Center, the rainforest has been degraded to the point where it can no longer maintain its own stable climate. Researchers also claim this may be the cause of to the worsening droughts that have been plaguing the area. This seems to be a very sensible claim, because if there is anything we have learned about the nature of the earth, it’s that everything is connected, and damaging one area can have very unpredictable effects elsewhere. 
-As bad as the situation may seem however, there is still hope, and proactive action can be taken in order to stop the destruction, and reverse the damage that has been done to the Amazon rainforest. Annual forest loss has gone down greatly from the staggering 21,130 square kilometers of the 1970s, and it has been estimated by the Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research that at least 20% of the land deforested in the Brazilian Amazon alone is re-growing forest. 
-In addition to this, as of August 28th of this year, Brazil has been successful in dismantling the largest deforestation gang active in Brazil’s rainforest. Going from being the largest contributor to this natural travesty, to taking such bold action to stop the continued loss of rain forest is setting an excellent example. 
-The message I really want to leave everyone with, is that the battle for the Amazon rainforest is still raging on today, despite the fact that the annual deforestation numbers have gone down significantly. The fact is, that we do not have very much of it left, and unless all the countries surrounding it realize their wrongs and begin taking reconstructive action like Brazil, we may lose this wonder of nature completely. The storm has not passed, and I would consider this to be a time of great urgency. 

-What we, as the consumers can do to help turn the tide in our favor, is make good, sustainable choices, and pay for the right products. Without us, they have no one to sell to. Only support brands with “no deforestation policies” and buy recycled or certified wood products. Make use of your consumer power! In addition to this, there are several laws that have been passed by our own country, such as the Wilderness act, and the Lacey Act, to stop illegal wood products from entering the U.S. We, as a nation, have the power to affect this situation in a positive way. Use your voting power to elect officials who have these concerns in their agendas, and have their hearts in the right place. May the rainforest live to see another year!!

False,Lets talk renewable energy,"Hey all.

I’ve posted here before with another topic from one of my environmental classes and am back to hopefully fuel some more discussion.  Our latest unit focused on energy; how we get it, direct and indirect effects of extraction and use, and what can be done to create a better energy environment.

We looked at the coal industry in the United States, and how it is extremely destructive in its extraction, as well as damaging to humans and the environment with its pollution.  We looked at wind turbines, and why people might oppose their construction.  What I’ve gathered from reading and talking about these issues is that, even though renewable energies may tout their benefits, there are many obstacles in front of every technology that need to be addressed in order for these green resources to become viable suppliers for major populations.

Some obstacles that I’ve thought of regarding a few specific renewable resources:

-Large solar farms will disrupt the ecosystems on which the panels are located (even if they are desolate desert environments)

-Demand for corn used for biofuels would skyrocket, perpetuating our destructive and polluting agricultural practices to meet this demand

-Wind turbines are noisy/an eyesore

-Wind turbines kill birds

Some, more general, issues with renewable energy sources as a whole are:

-Informing and convincing the general population on why we need to adopt and support these new sources of energy

-Gaining government support for these green energy companies, as many (most) politicians are uninformed about the technologies and are already so invested in conventional energy like coal and oil

I want to know what people think about these obstacles and dilemmas.  Also, does anybody have any numbers on the costs and benefits of these renewable sources?  Oil companies get huge tax breaks and subsidies; should these newer energy sources receive financial support as well, even though they are all relatively new?  I think they should, as this would provide aid for research and development as well as fuel some competition in the energy sector.  How do we properly educate people about our energy consumption?  We need people to be able to make their own informed opinions about energy sources in order to truly gain public support for these renewables.

I believe that renewables are a really important factor in becoming a more sustainable society, and I think these technologies should be taught about and advocated for so that people can learn about all of these different, responsible ways they can meet their energy needs.  Of course, a huge part of our energy dependence could be resolved if we simply used less energy, but that’s a whole other can of worms.

**TL;DR**: what do you people think about the current state of renewable energy? the future of green energy? 

Anyways, I’m rambling now but that’s because this topic is so broad and there is so much to discuss about these issues.  I’ll stop here and hopefully y’all can contribute to some dialogue.

False,Hey /r/environment! I need help with ideas for a college funded research project.,"If your college was offering you up to $4000 to create a proposal with literally no qualifications except that it's environmental related, what would you do?

I am a freshman studying sustainable agriculture/continental philosophy/urban environment/environmental science, and am really excited about all the possibilities that this opens up for me.

My plan (if funded) is to carry my proposal out in the summer, preferably in the Pacific North West (where I was raised). I am pondering an idea of a self-driven research project that would locate me in Yosemite, for example, for a period of time. I could do something as simple as hike all day and observe the local wildlife and take notes and illustrations and present my findings to my program. If I found a really interesting question that I can do on-the-field research for about an area,= that would be awesome too, but I do not know much about what needs to be answered.

Other ideas:
- Something related to a historical figure, such as John Muir or Lewis and Clark or Thoreau, and conduct an experiment following their trails and experiences or simply write about my research on them in the types of environments that they spent a lot of their time.
- Something art related, where I can live in a certain place for a period of time and create art pieces based on the nature of the area, perhaps donate pieces to the park/local town, and talk about how people find connections and relations between themselves and nature. 
- Living in really cool sustainable commune/community
- Participating in a survival program/natural science education program that I wouldn't be able to afford otherwise.
- Mapping my own trails

So many options! 

My university has a lot of money and are not toooo strict on what needs to come out of the project. My point of that is (not that it is my plan) but I can essentially create a proposal that sends me to Hawaii to feel the temperatures of the sands of difference beaches and then just lay on the beach all day, completely funded by my university.

My apologies for rambling - I am very excited about the possibilities. If you have any suggestions or comments or ideas let me know!

False,Redwood Planet Media Announces Feature Documentary Production,"Documentary Filmmaker Alan Peterson begins fundraising for Fecotopia: From Water Closet to Watershed.

McKinleyville, CA (WEB) DECEMBER 8, 2013 – Starting a not-for-profit documentary production company in Humboldt County is a daunting task, despite the area's richness in subject matter, since the economic realities of rural America compounded with the tepid national economy don't provide a rich environment for startups. But, since his 2010 arrival in the region, filmmaker Alan Peterson has met others who share the same goal, and filed the articles of incorporation for Redwood Planet Media, a public benefit corporation, this May.

“Northern California is home to unique natural treasures and ecological challenges,” Peterson said. “There are people here working on the cutting edge of sustainable energy, infrastructure and agriculture, yet all of this is largely overlooked by the national media. When I moved to McKinleyville, I wanted to be working on documentary projects to cover what makes this region important, but I encountered a complete void of job opportunities in the field. So, like many before me in Humboldt County, I went to work on building something from the ground up with a handful of likeminded people.”
Alan Peterson, along with fellow filmmakers Katy Warner and Ben Jacob, has therefor launched an Indiegogo campaign for their first project entitled Fecotopia: From Water Closet to Watershed. The campaign seeks to raise funds for a series of documentary shorts and full-length feature on the Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary. At 28% funded, and with 33 days left to fundraise, it looks like they are off to a good start thanks to recent shout-outs from Lost Coast Outpost and Friends of the Arcata Marsh.

Peterson remarks “Indiegogo provides a great platform for funding film projects. Being able to launch our projects with small donations from around the web lets us keep our focus where it should be: on the community, rather than on the whims of a large studio or corporate underwriters.”

The major perk for donating to Peterson's project is exclusive early access to the first nature short on their lineup, featuring the White-Tailed Kite family that regularly soars across Arcata Marsh to stake out territory and fight over prey. Other perks include a wide range of nature photography prints, a first edition movie poster, and canvas prints of these stunning photographs signed by the artist.

Fecotopia tells the story of a community in rural California that found a way to turn human waste into a valuable asset for the environment and the community. Three decades ago, the town of Arcata reclaimed a condemned landfill and abandoned log pond to create the Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary; a sewage treatment plant like none before it. By following the stories of the animals that live at the marsh, the people who enjoy it, and the history, science and forward-thinking behind the project that created an irreplaceable asset for the region, Fecotopia stands against the misconception that investing in the environment is taking away from humanity.

This production will primarily be filmed on RED Digital Cinema cameras, some of the most advanced cinema equipment available. To learn more about the film, readers can visit the project's pitch page here:

False,EU ministers reached a deal on fishing quotas today.,"I couldn't find a good summary that mentions the big picture of the deal that has been reached by EU fishing minsters today so I assembled this for reddit:

For the last couple of days, EU agriculture and fishing ministers have gathered to set this year's new quotas on fishing in the EU. These talks try to find a comprimise between scientific and environmental recommendations and business interests. Official documents are [not online yet](http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/fishing_rules/tacs/index_en.htm) but media reports are ambiguous. Some say that the fishing quotas have been lowered even though [original higher ambitions were not met](https://www.google.com/news?ncl=db6Tf24xCss2OcM_4cJGitTXueDqM&q=eu+quota+fish&lr=Dutch&hl=en), while most articles mention higher quotas on national levels. The apparent contradiction is possible because of a ['more scientific approach'](http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Brussels-backs-evidence-based-fish-quotas/story-17626771-detail/story.html) where the most threatened species cannot be fished much but total catch can still increase.

Ireland fought hard for its own economical interests and is satisfied since it can fish [6.500 tons extra](http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/coveney-new-eu-fish-quotas-a-good-deal-for-irish-fishermen-578495.html).
Belgium [reacts positively](http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=DMF20121220_00408718) because it's mostly interested in catching plaice which is not threatened either. The [UK is happy as well](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/uk-hails-eu-deal-on-fish-catch-quotas.1355988652). I couldn't find articles from other countries but I may not have looked hard enough.


The pattern of these talks usually goes like this: scientists estimate the highest number of fish that can be caught without fish stocks declining even further. EU ministers discuss the quotas with the fishing industry and their own national interests. Actual quotas are set and these are on average [45% higher](http://en.mercopress.com/2012/12/17/wwf-blasts-eu-fishing-quotas-ahead-of-ministerial-meeting) than what scientists recommend. Apart from the legal overfishing, illegal fishing supplies another large section of the European market (according to the documentary 'end of the line' half of the fish caught in Europe is illegal but I couldn't find any data on this.) [Bycatch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bycatch) (fish that the fishing ship has no permit for and thus have to be thrown back into the sea, usually dead) is another big problem for fish stocks. In the Irish sea and the Mediterranean sea [80%](http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/status-of-marine-fish-stocks/status-of-marine-fish-stocks-1) of fish is overfished.

While fishing quotas increase, only a fraction of fish populations in 1900 remain ([graphical comparison](http://stefanprocopiu.vaslui.rdsnet.ro/eft/images/Plenty%20more%20fish%20in%20the%20sea.png)). Worldwide, [only 10%](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-05/s-ncs051303.php) of large fish like tuna, cod, halibut and marlin are left. With business as usual policies, seas worldwide could be devoid of edible fish by 2048, [warn scientists](http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500368_162-2147223.html).

Ironically, it may well be that the survival of our species, and perhaps even life as we know it, is dependent upon learning the very lessons of empathy, responsibility and self-control that the vegan ideal embodies, and that our society seems so reluctant to embrace.

With our society and our world within sight of a major breakdown from resource scarcity and subsequent geopolitical conflict, it has become crucial that we face up to the need for a radical shift – in behavior and beliefs. Drastic, sweeping changes are needed, and this fundamental shift in society's values must begin with each one of us.

No matter how strong the current opposition, it will soon have to be accepted that the vegan solution is our hope for the future, as it contains the power to address, all at once, the many different yet interconnected issues – from the environmental devastation we are causing, to the global pandemic of violence. These crises are crippling our civilization and threaten not only our survival, but the survival of the many other species that populate the planet.

Making the transition toward a vegan way of life is the single-most important investment an individual can make in the future of our planet and our civilization. By becoming vegan, each of us can lessen our ecological footprint more than with any other personal change, as well as take our health into our own hands, work toward eliminating world hunger, rediscover our connection with the other animals with whom we share our world, and make a powerful personal contribution toward the beginning of peace on earth.

The world stands at a turning point. We simply cannot go on as if our old ways can continue to sustain us. As environmentalist John Grant states in The Green Marketing Manifesto, *""Our lifestyles need to change **beyond recognition**."" (Emphasis in original).*

As industrialization expands ever further – now including large Asian populations – it brings with it the excesses of animal agriculture. Resource depletion, pollution, species extinction, and global warming are increasing at an alarming rate, and we currently run the risk of driving into collapse the essential life-preserving systems of the planet itself.

Our appetite for flesh and for the products that come from the bodies of animals, combined with our growing human population, has caused us to create systems of animal 'farming' that are not only completely unsustainable in the long-term, but are also immediately damaging to many of the natural eco-systems that we depend on, including rainforests, rivers, oceans, grasslands, marshes, and even the atmosphere.

Despite assertions to the contrary, even 'free-range' or 'grass-fed' animal farming is destructive to the natural environment. For more information, please see [Free-Range is not the Answer.](http://www.care2.com/causes/environment/blog/free-range-is-not-the-answer/)

Livestock's Long Shadow, the now well-known report from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, stated that ""livestock production is one of the major causes of the world's most pressing environmental problems, including global warming, land degradation, air and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity.""

Around a third of the land on this planet is involved in livestock production, according to the FAO, which also estimates that animal agriculture generates nearly a fifth (18 percent) of the world’s greenhouse gases - more than all transportation. Animal agriculture also requires enormous amounts of water and energy, and ever-increasing quantities of [soy, corn, and other grains,](http://www.care2.com/causes/animal-welfare/blog/the-vegan-evolution-a-new-era-for-humanity/) leading to the destruction of vast tracts of rainforests. Agriculture in the United States – a large percentage of which serves the demand for animal products – contributes to nearly three-quarters of all water-quality problems in the nation’s rivers and streams, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

For too long, the environmental movement has emphasized small lifestyle changes, without addressing the core issues behind the problems, mistakenly teaching people that it is possible to 'make a difference' without making substantial changes in one's personal behavior. This is where the vegan solution contains the power to revitalize the environmental movement, because it embodies exactly what is required to inspire the necessary change: a revival and restoration of our core ethical values.

The global environmental crisis and the global humanitarian crisis offer us a wealth of opportunities. They are opportunities for change, for conscious evolution of ourselves, which is something we humans collectively resist as much as anything. Changing oneself requires an admission that something in us needs to change, and that is a challenge for anyone. But the rewards of making such a change are profound. The keys to a new world of safety and plenty are at our fingertips. What we must do is to embrace and encourage the evolution of values that will illuminate our choices and show us a peaceful and prosperous way forward.
